      " OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study are to test the Diaphragm Pacing Stimulation (DPS) System for treating chronic ventilatory insufficiency in persons with respiratory muscle paralysis. The hypothesis being tested in the clinical trial is that laparoscopic stimulation of the diaphragm at the motor point with intramuscular electrodes is safe and effective in providing significant ventilatory support to individuals who are otherwise dependant on a mechanical ventilator. Patients in our initial study group have all suffered from high-level spinal cord injury and were full-time dependant on positive pressure mechanical ventilation prior to inclusion. \n",
      " System: NeuRx RA/4 Diaphragm Pacing Stimulation System Summary: The NeuRx-RA/4 is intended to be used by individuals that have sustained a spinal cord injury, requiring aid with respiration. The device connects to the diaphragm which delivers current to stimulate muscle contractions to aid in respirations. This device currently holds an Investigational Device Exemption No. G920162 in the United States and is currently undergoing clinical trials at University Hospitals (Cleveland), Shepherd Center (Atlanta) and Vancouver (Canada). Introduction: The purpose of the study is to determine if a new, investigational diaphragm pacing system can provide part or full time respiratory support to spinal cord injured persons who normally need a mechanical ventilator. Patients with high-level spinal cord injuries typically experience chronic ventilatory insufficiency due to respiratory muscle paralysis; these patients must be supported predominantly through positive pressure mechanical ventilation with a ventilator. The diaphragm pacing system (NeuRx-RA/4) provides an electrical signal to the motor point of the muscle that causes the diaphragm to contract and allows patients to breathe more naturally. Synapse Biomedical, in conjunction with Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals of Cleveland, are evaluating activating the diaphragm with percutaneous intramuscular electrodes implanted laparoscopically. This eliminates any direct contact with the phrenic nerve, allows all circuitry and electronics to remain outside the body, and provides direct, selective activation to each hemidiaphragm. The NeuRx RA/4 Diaphragm Pacing Stimulation (DPS) System has been implanted in 49 individuals with high-level spinal cord injury, resulting in over 20 years of cumulative active implantation time. The longest term patient was implanted March 6, 2000 and has been using the DPS System as his sole means of respiratory support for over five years. With the exception of the second patient, who does not meet our revised inclusion criteria and has gained no benefit from the implant, all of the remaining patients have been able to achieve significant tidal volumes with the DPS System. Based on the current results, the NeuRx RA/4 DPS System has demonstrated safety and efficacy in patients with high-level spinal cord injury. Given the results to date the study has demonstrated preliminary efficacy in this patient population. With no unexpected significant adverse events reported the NeuRx RA/4 DPS System has performed reliably and safely in this patient population. Device Description: The NeuRx RA/4 Respiratory System is manufactured by Synapse Biomedical. The NeuRx RA/4 System comprises the following components: an external, battery powered Stimulator Device, an associated Programmer/Controller, Intramuscular Electrodes, associated percutaneous Lead Wires, a Surgical Placement Tool Set, and a surgical Mapping Station. Inclusion Criteria: - Age 18 years or older - Cervical spinal cord injury dependent on mechanical ventilation - Clinically stable following acute spinal cord injury - Bilateral phrenic nerve function clinically acceptable as demonstrated with EMG recordings and nerve conduction times - Diaphragm movement with stimulation visible under fluoroscopy - Clinically acceptable oxygenation on room air (>90%) - Hemodynamically stable - No medical co-morbidities that would interfere with the proper placement or function of the device - Committed primary caregiver - Negative pregnancy test in females of child-bearing potential - Informed consent from patient or designated representative Exclusion Criteria: - Co-morbid medical conditions that preclude surgery - Active lung disease (obstructive, restrictive or membrane diseases) - Active cardiovascular disease - Active brain disease - Hemodynamic instability or low oxygen levels on room air - Hospitalization for or a treated active infection within the last 3 months - Significant scoliosis or chest deformity - Marked obesity - Anticipated poor compliance with protocol by either patient or primary caregiver. - Currently breastfeeding \n",

      " Acute otitis media (inflammation of the middle ear) occurs in 60% of infants during the first year of life and in 85% by age 3. Approximately 17% of children suffer recurrent otitis media during the first year of life. Following acute otitis media, middle ear fluid effusions can persist for weeks to months. Approximately 40% of children with middle ear effusions have mild to moderate hearing loss for the duration of the effusion, and several studies have found evidence for impaired speech and language development among children with prolonged middle ear effusion. Since antibiotic use has become widespread, concern has emerged regarding antibiotic resistant S. pneumoniae strains and other bacteria. Children with recurrent otitis media commonly receive prophylactic antibiotic therapy or surgical insertion of tubes to prevent accumulation of middle ear effusion. The prevalence of pediatric use of complementary alternative medical (CAM) approaches for prevention of otitis media has not been widely quantified.

      "Title = Acupuncture and Hypertension.\n",
      " Although traditional Chinese medicine advocates the use of acupuncture not only to induce analgesia but also to treat essential hypertension, acupuncture's postulated antihypertensive efficacy in humans has not been subjected to rigorous Western scientific testing. Before advocating acupuncture as an effective complementary/alternative medicine strategy for essential hypertension, it is necessary to demonstrate that the beneficial effects of acupuncture are scientifically robust, long-lasting, and explicable in terms of modern scientific mechanisms. In spontaneously hypertensive rats, acupuncture-like electrical stimulation of thinly myelinated (Group III) somatic afferents activates central endorphin (naloxone-sensitive) pathways that elicit long-lasting decreases in sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) and blood pressure. The ability to record SNA with microelectrodes in conscious humans provides a new opportunity to test this novel mechanistic hypothesis in patients undergoing electroacupuncture, a modification of the ancient technique that provides a quantifiable and reproducible stimulus to human skeletal muscle afferents. Using a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled design, we will test the following major hypotheses: Electroacupuncture produces a long-lasting reduction in SNA, thereby providing a safe and effective complementary treatment of human hypertension. Given the enormous interest in acupuncture by our lay public, but the paucity of Western scientific data about its efficacy in cardiovascular disorders, our studies in normotensive and hypertensive humans should provide a conceptual framework for deciding whether to accept or reject the large body of Chinese (and Russian) literature advocating acupuncture as a safe and effective treatment of essential hypertension and other cardiovascular disorders (such as heart failure, and myocardial ischemia). \n",

      " The objective of this study is to test alternative treatment strategies to reduce the frequency of chronic diarrhea among HIV positive individuals. 60 percent of patients with HIV disease in the U.S. will have diarrhea at some point in their illness. Although in general many of the opportunistic infections (OI's) associated with HIV have decreased due to new \"drug cocktails\", many of these drugs, however, have diarrhea as a side effect. In Asian countries, acupuncture (including moxibustion) has been widely used for the treatment of various gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. However, there are no published studies that test treatment protocols using acupuncture or moxibustion on patients with HIV experiencing chronic diarrhea. \n",
      " The subjects in the study will be 144 men and women with HIV infection who report experiencing 3 or more episodes of diarrhea (non-pathogen related) per 24 hour period for 3 weeks or more. Subjects will be randomized to one of four experimental intervention conditions: Condition 1 subjects receive true acupuncture and true moxibustion; Condition 2 subjects receive true acupuncture and placebo moxibustion; Condition 3, subjects receive true moxibustion and sham acupuncture; Condition 4( Control Group), subjects receive sham acupuncture and placebo moxibustion. Subjects in Conditions 1,2,3,& 4 will attend 20 scheduled sessions over 24 weeks. Week 1 is a baseline session followed by two sessions per week for weeks 2-8 (sessions 2-15), one session per week for weeks 9, 10, 11 and 12 (sessions 16, 17, 18 & 19) and a final follow-up session at week 24. All subjects will complete daily bowel movement and medication data collection diaries for the duration of the study. Measurement of quality of life and level of functioning will be taken pre-intervention (session 1), week 6 (session 10), week 12 (session 19) and week 24 (session 20). All interventions will be implemented by licensed acupuncturists trained in traditional Chinese medicine. This study is designed to assess the efficacy of two alternative medicine treatments for chronic diarrhea associated with HIV in a prospective, randomized, controlled, blinded, parallel groups study under the intent-to-treat principle. True acupuncture, moxibustion, and combination therapy, in which specific meridian points are stimulated according to protocol, will be compared to each other and with the control group, with one-way ANOVA models for pre-treatment minus post-treatment difference scores for diarrhea frequency and stool consistency as the dependent measures and treatment group assignment (Conditions 1 - 4) as the independent variable. Average pretreatment diarrhea frequency and stool consistency scores will be entered as covariates into these models. Sample size determination for the above analysis, based on preliminary data, with 80% power and a two-tailed type I error rate of .05% by the method of Holm (1979) and a 20% attrition factor indicates the need for 36 subjects assigned to each condition to detect a 0.95-standardized difference between the most extreme experimental conditions. \n",

      " Fibromyalgia is the second most common rheumatic disorder, affecting approximately 8-10 million persons in the U.S., and is characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain and soft tissue tenderness upon examination. This study focuses on the use of acupuncture as a mode of therapy for fibromyalgia. The issues under examination are: 1) the optimal duration of treatment, 2) the independent and synergistic effects of needle placement and needle stimulation, and 3) appropriate control strategies. The proposal utilizes a randomized, blinded, sham-controlled design to achieve these aims. Subjects are randomly assigned to one of four groups: 1)active site with stimulation, 2) active site, without stimulation, 3) sham site with stimulation, and 4) sham site, without stimulation. All subjects will receive acupuncture at escalating frequency, beginning at once per week and ending at 3 times per week. This \"forced titration\" design allows for the detection of inter-subject differences in responsiveness to acupuncture, as well as the factors which may predict responsiveness (or lack thereof). Secondary goals of the study are to collect data on the mechanism, safety, and cost-effectiveness of acupuncture in fibromyalgia, and to determine the optimal outcome measures, for a full scale research clinical trial. \n",

      " Depression is an unfortunately common condition for which people often seek alternative (non-Western) treatments, perhaps because conventional treatments do not consistently provide lasting relief. A pilot study (Allen, Schnyer and Hitt, 1998) suggests that acupuncture, a popular but under-researched alternative treatment derived from Chinese medicine, holds sufficient promise as a treatment for depression to warrant a larger-scale clinical trial. The investigators propose to conduct a larger-scale test of the efficacy of acupuncture in this trial. Because relapse and recurrence of Major Depression are quite common, the investigators also will assess the clinical status of participants for 18 months after treatment concludes. In the first phase of this double-blind randomized clinical trial, 150 men and women meeting criteria for Major Depression will be randomly assigned to a treatment approach or to a waitlist control. All participants will ultimately receive acupuncture designed to address their own particular constellation of depressive symptoms. At the end of this first phase, blind assessments will be used to compare treatment effects from the perspectives of both Western psychiatry and Chinese medicine. After this treatment phase, participants will be assessed several times over the next 18 months. The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and clinical significance of acupuncture as a treatment for Major Depression, and to examine the convergence of Western-based and Chinese-medicine-based outcome measures. Finally, the study will determine whether changes in energetic pattern mediate changes in Western defined depression severity, and explore whether patient and history variables predict responses to acupuncture treatments. \n",

      " The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of meditation on older African Americans with documented cardiovascular disease (CVD). \n",
      " Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and disability in older African Americans, and accounts for 40% of the disproportionate risk for mortality observed in African Americans compared to white Americans. The majority of CVD patients experience acute cardiac events, many sudden and unexpected, despite conventional treatment of their disease and associated traditional risk factors. The pathophysiologic basis of these cardiac events is not fully established, but substantial evidence indicates that psychosocial stress and the sympathetic nervous system have adverse effects on both vasomotor function and long-term autonomic balance. Recent advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of acute cardiac events-specifically, the roles that arterial vasomotor dysfunction and sympathetic nervous system imbalance play in the pathophysiology of such acute events-provide a platform for a new mechanistic investigation of the interplay of psychosocial and environmental stress and CVD. Preliminary evidence demonstrating elevated peripheral vasoconstriction due to stress-mediated sympathetic nervous system response in African Americans further suggests that these mechanisms are particularly relevant in this group. \n",

      "Title = Complementary Naturopathic Medicine for Periodontitis.\n",
      " This study aims to assess selected naturopathic medicines for adult periodontitis and to identify variables that influence successful outcomes when traditional and alternative approaches to preventing and treating periodontal diseases are combined. Collaboration between Kaiser Permanente, Oregon Health Science University and the National College of Naturopathic Medicine provides an unsurpassed environment for such investigations. Periodontitis is a major cause of tooth loss and negatively impacts systemic health. The limitations of traditional periodontal treatment have compelled scientists and clinicians to investigate new remedies, and naturopathic medicine holds several promising interventions. Because they are used to improve elements of host resistance that are known to be important in periodontal health and disease, three naturopathic medicines are potential adjuncts in preventing and treating periodontitis. Connective tissue components are enzymatically degraded in periodontitis. In naturopathy, Connective Tissue Nutrient Formula (CTNF) (vitamins A, C and D, glucosamine sulfate, oligoproanthocyanindins, copper, zinc, manganese, boron, silicon, magnesium, and calcium) is prescribed specifically to enhance the integrity of key connective tissue elements and improve their resistance to degradation. Periodontitis begins when permeability of the oral sulcular epithelium permits pathogenic bacterial components to invade deeper periodontal connective tissues. In naturopathy, glutamine is prescribed to reduce oral-intestinal epithelial membrane permeability. Chronic activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis during the stress response, is a risk factor for periodontitis. Adaptogenic herbs (AH) (Panax ginseng, Withania somnifera and Eleutherococcus senticosus) are prescribed by naturopathic physicians to reverse the impact of bacterial and psychosocial stressors. Because glutamine, CTNF and AH target pathophysiologic mechanisms known to underline periodontitis, they are compelling candidates in clinical and mechanistic investigations of complementary medicine approaches to the management of periodontitis. Kaiser Permanente adult periodontitis patients will serve as subjects and receive standard periodontal treatment. Three of the four randomly assigned groups will also receive supplements of glutamine, CTNF, or AH. We will determine the effects of these supplements on clinical outcomes (attachment loss, pocket depths, indicators of inflammation, plaque composition, need for periodontal surgery, acute periodontal problems, tooth loss). In addition to completing the battery of self-report measures (stress, coping, quality of life), study subjects will provide samples of blood, saliva, gingival cervicular fluid and bacterial dental plaque. These samples will be examined as part of the Laboratory Core to identify biologic and genetic characteristics that correlate with successful outcomes. Storage of portions of the samples will allow future examination of additional variables as part of the Developmental Projects carried out as the Craniofacial Complementary & Alternative Center is established and Phase III trials are undertaken. \n",

      "Title = Dietary Phytoestrogens and Bone Metabolism.\n",
      " The purpose of this study is to determine whether dietary phytoestrogens are an effective alternative to postmenopausal exogenous estrogen replacement therapy in preventing bone loss. \n",
      " Osteoporosis in postmenopausal women is one of the most important public health challenges of our time. With millions of women affected and billions of dollars being spent for its complications, we need to develop effective approaches to this disease. Postmenopausal women are at particular risk because the loss of estrogen associated with the menopause leads to bone loss of much greater magnitude than one would expect on the basis of age alone. Estrogen replacement therapy, a logical and effective therapeutic approach, has been associated with serious concerns about adverse events and, thus, limited use. The recent development of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMS) may help if they continue to show promise. Interest in natural sources of estrogenic substances to prevent postmenopausal bone loss is an expected outgrowth of the general interest in alternative medicinals for a wide variety of human disorders. Concerns about the potential for adverse consequences of the conventional use of estrogen replacement therapy, and limited knowledge about long term use of SERMS- add support to this quest. No systematic investigation of the role of dietary phytoestrogens on bone mass and skeletal dynamics has yet been conducted. With the dramatic increase in interest in these sources of estrogenic activity, it is important for us to determine whether these agents are efficacious. Otherwise, this field will be plagued for years to come by incomplete, anecdotal and scientifically poorly documented actions of these agents on bone metabolism. It is our expectation that this study will begin to provide the documentary information that the field so clearly needs. The rationale for exploring the potential for phytoestrogens in the maintenance of skeletal health in postmenopausal women is clear and compelling. Women will be randomly assigned to one of three healthy eating plans and, over the course of the year-long study, will learn to choose and cook foods to help optimize health as they go through menopause and beyond. \n",

      " The primary aim of the present study is to test the effect of alpha-tocopherol supplementation on the progression of carotid atherosclerosis in patients with coronary artery disease \n",
      " Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Westernized populations. Oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) appears to be a crucial step in atherogenesis. Thus, the role of dietary micronutrients in decreasing LDL oxidation assumes considerable significance. The most consistent data with respect to micronutrient antioxidants and atherosclerosis appear to relate to a-tocopherol (AT), the predominant lipid-soluble antioxidant in LDL. In addition to decreasing LDL oxidation, data support an effect of AT on critical cells in atherogenesis (monocytes, smooth muscle cells, and endothelium) that are potentially anti-atherogenic. The primary aim of the present study is to test the effect of AT supplementation (1200 IU/day of RRR-AT) in a placebo-controlled, randomized double blind trial over 2 years on the progression of carotid atherosclerosis in patients with coronary artery disease (stable angina pectoris or previous myocardial infarction). Subjects recruited would have to be on the American Heart Association Phase II diet and a HMG CoA reductase inhibitor for at least one year and have an LDL cholesterol <125 mg/dL on 2 visits at least 4 weeks apart during the 10 month lead in phase. Intimal-medial thickness (IMT) of both carotids, including the common carotid, the bulb and the proximal internal carotid will be determined by high-resolution B-mode sonography. At six month intervals blood samples will be obtained for liver enzymes, creatinine, complete blood count, lipid profile, antioxidant and fatty acid levels, LDL oxidation, plasma soluble CAMS (cell adhesion molecules) and monocyte activity. Also, an early morning urine sample will be obtained for F2 -isoprostanes, a direct measure of lipid peroxidation. IMT will be determined at baseline, 1, 1.5 and 2 years. The mean change in IMT and rate of progression will be compared between the AT and placebo groups. Following isolation, the LDL will be subjected to copper catalyzed oxidation over a 5-hour period. From this will be obtained the lag phase and oxidation rate. Isolated monocytes will be activated with lipopolysaccharide and the following activities assayed: superoxide anion release, interleukin-1 j3 release and adhesion to human endothelium. F2 isoprostanes and VCAM, ICAM, and E- 8 P-Selectin will be quantitated by ELISA. AT levels and the parameters of LDL oxidation and monocyte activity will be correlated with changes in IMT. If this study shows that high-dose AT supplementation is beneficial in retarding atherosclerosis this could emerge as an important adjunctive therapy in the management of cardiovascular disease. \n",

      " Most American women will spend the last third of their lives post-menopause. During this time, chronically low levels of steroidal estrogens may lead to a number of short and long-term medical sequelae such as hot flashes, vaginal dryness, heart disease, and osteoporosis. While some physicians believe that demonstrated beneficial effects of estrogen, particularly on the cardiovascular and skeletal systems, warrant the taking of hormone therapy from menopause on, many women choose not to take estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) and are increasingly exploring alternative approaches to ERT. For centuries, black cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa) has been used worldwide for women's health. Despite its long-standing use, studies of black cohosh have yielded conflicting data, in part because of lack in study design rigor and the short duration of studies to date. The primary aim of this study is to correct past shortcomings in study design to determine whether treatment with black cohosh is effective in treating menopausal symptoms. Participants in this study will be given black cohosh for a 12-month period. Potential mechanisms of action of black cohosh will be examined by quantifying the levels of sex hormones, including estradiol, estrone, FSH, and LH. Because black cohosh may act as an estrogenic agent, the effect on endometrium will be evaluated by sonogram and by monitoring the incidence of adverse events and compliance with the study. \n",

      " The purpose of this study is to compare an herbal supplement, nonfood-derived vitamins, and placebo for the care of cardiovascular disease in high risk older African Americans. \n",
      " Older African Americans suffer from disproportionately high rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality. In response to the health disparity between older African Americans and whites, national mandates have called for new research on innovative approaches to CVD prevention in this high risk population. Oxidative stress has recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic CVD. Available evidence from epidemiological studies, clinical trials, and laboratory mechanistic studies indicate that antioxidant interventions may be useful in the prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic CVD in high risk older populations. Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that dietary or food sources of antioxidant nutrients may be more clinically effective than conventional nonfood-derived vitamin supplementation. Surveys indicate relatively high rates of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use, including herbal medicines, in older African Americans. Yet, with the exception of the previous clinical trials of the present Center team, there have been few controlled studies on CAM therapies in older African Americans and no previous controlled studies on efficacy and mechanisms of herbal antioxidants for the prevention of CVD in this high risk population. Preliminary studies have found that a CAM herbal preparation (MAK) derived from traditional Vedic medicine demonstrates potent antioxidant and anti-atherogenic effects in laboratory and pilot human studies. This study will evaluate the effects of this traditional CAM herbal preparation in older African Americans. This will be a controlled clinical trial at field site, Howard University Medical Center in Washington, DC, involving 138 older African American men and women (55 years of age and older) with documented atherosclerotic CVD who will be randomized to supplementation with either the traditional CAM herbal preparation (MAK 4+5), conventional vitamin cocktail (E+C) or placebo for 12 months. Clinical and mechanistic outcomes include carotid artery atherosclerosis (IMT), endothelial dysfunction (brachial artery reactivity), oxidized LDL, traditional CVD risk factors (BP, lipids, diet, exercise, smoking, weight) and quality of life. Participants will continue usual care. The results of this clinical study will provide much needed understanding of the basic and clinical effects of a traditional herbal antioxidant preparation on pathophysiological mechanisms of atherosclerotic CVD in this high risk group. This will facilitate translation of research findings on CAM into clinical practice for prevention of disease in this underserved and understudied population of high risk older African Americans. \n",

      " The object of this study is to determine if Reiki will improve glycemic control and cardiac autonomic function diabetic patients with painful neuropathy. \n",
      " The incidence of coronary heart disease(CHD) in type II diabetes is currently at least 20% in subjects 65 years and older. Numerous data suggest that hyperglycemia may be an independent risk factor for macrovascular complications. Diabetic painful neuropathy (DPN) affects 5-50% of patients with diabetes and is exacerbated by poor glycemic control. DPN is characterized by acute functional abnormalities in nerve fibers followed by chronic nerve fiber loss and blunted nerve fiber regeneration. Symptoms include tingling and burning sensations in the calves, ankles and feet. Pharmacological treatment of diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DAN) and DPN include tricyclic antidepressants, which are cardiotoxic and have a low efficacy rate. The ADA recommends the utilization of diet and exercise as the primary means of glycemic control, and therefore of DPN. Because of the increased levels of extremity pain, patients with DPN are less likely to include exercise as a part of their health regimen. Diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DAN) commonly complicates diabetes and has been invoked as a cause of sudden death in diabetic patients. The excess cardiac mortality in diabetics appears to be augmented by the presence of DAN in patients with advanced deficits in sympathetic cardiovascular enervation which may augment cardiac arrhythmogenesis. An bio-energy modality known as Reiki is an energy manipulation technique similar to Therapeutic Touch, a hands-on modality familiar in nursing for the relief of chronic pain, as well as accelerate healing in full thickness dermal wounds. The study approach is to apply Reiki to patients with DPN +/- DAN in a semi-double blind, randomized, crossover study to ascertain if glycemic control and cardiac autonomic function are improved in these patients. Outcome measures will include HBA1c values, the McGill-Melzack Pain Questionnaire, and a quality of life questionnaire. Participants will also be tested as to their ability to tolerate exercise by a 6 minute walk test. This study will help elucidate whether an bio-energy technique can reduce pain levels, improve glycemic control by increasing exercise tolerance and improve cardiac autonomic function, both major contributors to CHD mortality. \n",

      " Fibromyalgia (FM), one of the most common rheumatic conditions, is a condition of unknown etiology characterized by widespread muscle pain and stiffness. Treatment is generally unsatisfactory and most randomized, controlled treatment trials have been unable to demonstrate a sustained effective intervention. A single, brief trial of electroacupuncture demonstrated remarkable improvement among patients with FM, although lasting effects were not evaluated. Nonetheless, the recently published National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Statement on Acupuncture says \"musculoskeletal conditions such as fibromyalgia, myofascial pain ....are conditions for which acupuncture may be beneficial\". Thus, 96 patients will be recruited from a referral clinic for fatigue for a 12 week (24 treatments) trial. These patients will be randomized into 3 control groups and 1 \"true\" acupuncture group. The control groups will consist of a group receiving acupuncture treatment for an unrelated condition (morning sickness), a group receiving needle insertion at non-channel, non-point locations, and a \"true\" placebo group. This latter group will have acupuncture needle guides tapped on the skin, then needles tapped. Thus, the specific aims of this study are to 1) evaluate the short and long term efficacy and side effects of a 12 week randomized, controlled trial of bi-weekly acupuncture in the treatment of FM; 2) establish the most useful and scientifically sound control group for studies of acupuncture using FM as a model for conditions characterized by chronic pain; 3) use both subjective and objective measures of overall health and pain to determine the optimal time length of treatment; and 4) examine the concordance of allopathic and acupuncture-based measures of outcome. For the purposes of this study, subjects will be asked to complete a unique set of study measures at enrollment, at 4, 8, and 12 weeks, and then again at 1 and 6 months post-treatment. Our primary outcomes will be patient global assessment, subjective pain, and mean number of tender points. Secondary outcomes will be pain threshold, analgesic use, physician global assessment, functional status, sleep, psychological distress, and fatigue. Thus, this trial will have both immediate and longer term implications for the scientific study of acupuncture as well as the clinical care of the estimated 5 million patients with FM in the US. From a methodological point of view, the proposed trial will establish the most appropriate methods for choosing a control group should larger trials be conducted, suggest the optimum duration of treatment, and evaluate the utility of diverse allopathic and alternative outcome measures. Of equal importance, however, this research will test and potentially establish the effectiveness of acupuncture. \n",

Because of the increased cancer risk, many women seek out alternatives to ERT. Phytoestrogens, plant compounds that have estrogenic effects, have been a focus of interest as an alternative to ERT. The isoflavones and lignans are two major classes of phytoestrogens that occur in the food supply. Among the former, soy foods have attracted much interest, while among the latter, whole grains and seeds are sources in a typical diet. More specifically, women consuming a macrobiotic diet have been observed to have extremely high levels of phytoestrogen metabolites in their urine, perhaps 10 to 20 times that seen in women consuming an omnivorous diet. Proponents of a macrobiotic diet have proposed that it is beneficial in the context of cancer therapy, as well as for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease. This study will investigate, in a randomized, three-arm study, the effects of two interventions that are high in phytoestrogens on various parameters related to estrogen metabolism and fibrinolysis. Approximately 120 women will be randomized to receive an American Heart Association (AHA) Step 1 diet, an AHA Step 2 diet + 10 g/day flax seed, or a macrobiotic dietary intervention. Blood and urine samples will be drawn at baseline, and at three, six, nine, and twelve months, to examine both short and long-term effects of these interventions. Outcomes include blood and urine levels of total estrogens and estradiol, and related metabolites; antigens to plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), fibrin D-dimer, and von Willebrand Factor; and endothelial function as measured by high-resolution ultrasound. Blood levels of antioxidant vitamins and retinoids will also be examined. This study should provide information on whether these alternative, high phytoestrogen dietary interventions result in favorable effects on these biological parameters that are related to risk of major diseases of aging. \n",

      " The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of three antioxidant regimens in treating the symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS). \n",
      " Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune mediated disease of the central nervous system that affects over 350,000 Americans. T lymphocytes, macrophages and soluble mediators of inflammation cause demyelination and axonal injury in MS. Activated macrophages release nitric oxide and oxygen free radicals that cause demyelination and axonal injury in MS and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Natural antioxidants may favorably influence the course of MS by decreasing oxidative injury. Chronic relapsing EAE in mouse models is clinically and pathologically useful for testing potential therapies for MS. This study will assess three natural antioxidant regimens for their potential as treatments for MS: Ginkgo biloba, alpha-lipoic acid/essential fatty acids, and vitamin E/selenium. The effects of each regimen will be compared to determine which regimen appears most effective at suppressing EAE and decreasing markers of oxidative injury in patients with MS. As part of this study, two smaller trials will be conducted. A Phase I/II trial in patients with MS will determine if the selected antioxidant regimen can decrease disease activity as detected with gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. The results of this study will serve as the basis for a Phase III trial to assess the long term effectiveness of natural antioxidant therapy in MS. \n",

      "Title = Nonpharmacologic Analgesia for Invasive Procedures.\n",
      " Analgesics and sedatives administered to control distress from minimally invasive surgical procedures have limited effectiveness and serious side effects. Unabated distress not only interferes with smooth progression of the ongoing procedure, but can elicit adverse responses when patients need additional intervention. The long-term objective of this research is to provide a safe and practical behavioral method for reducing cognitive and physiologic distress associated with invasive procedures. Currently, this method should benefit at least 8 million patients annually in the US. Extrapolating the risk of intravenous conscious sedation to the number of invasive procedures performed annually, we predict that 47,000 patients will suffer serious cardiorespiratory complications and 2,600 will die. These numbers do not include effects of the psychological damage inflicted by poorly managed procedure-related stress on patients' subsequent health behavior. This application sets out to pursue three aims: 1) Prospectively determine the impact of self-hypnotic relaxation on cognitive and physiologic distress during tumor embolizations; 2) Prospectively determine the impact of self-hypnotic relaxation on distress in the postoperative period; 3) Determine the impact of intraprocedural self-hypnotic relaxation on distress during subsequent tumor embolization. We hypothesize that: 1) Self-hypnotic relaxation decreases cognitive and physiologic distress during tumor embolizations. 2) Self-hypnotic relaxation decreases cognitive and physiologic distress after tumor embolization when post-embolization ischemia is expected to induce painful stimuli and systemic distress. 3) The beneficial effect of self-hypnotic coping skills acquired during an invasive procedure carries over to the next invasive procedure. Upon completion, the efficacy and durability of procedural administration of nonpharmacologic analgesia will be known by a rigorous and practical assessment. The relative performance of self-hypnotic relaxation will be quantified compared to standard care and empathic controls in a well-characterized population of patients within the controlled and monitored environment of a busy interventional radiology practice. Results from this competing renewal will provide the next level of data needed for future study design to determine broad clinical utility in a multicenter randomized controlled trial. \n",

      " The mission of the Oregon Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine in Neurological Disorders (ORCCAMIND) is to facilitate research and education on the effectiveness and mechanisms of action of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies in the treatment of neurological disorders. The integration of conventional medicine and CAM communities is critical for the success of ORCCAMIND. Thus, ORCCAMIND is composed of six institutions: Oregon Health Sciences University; National College of Naturopathic Medicine; Western States Chiropractic College; Oregon College of Oriental Medicine; the Linus Pauling Institute at Oregon State University; and the Portland Veterans Affairs Medical Center. ORCCAMIND will initially focus on the use of CAM antioxidants and stress reduction as treatments for neurodegenerative and demyelinating diseases because many of these diseases have oxidative injury as a causative or contributory factor and several CAM approaches have direct or indirect anti-oxidant effects. Through the Career Development Program the Developmental Research Program and the activities of the Education and Information Core, we will also foster and promote research into other CAM approaches for neurologic diseases that extend beyond anti-oxidant therapies. ORCCAMIND will achieve its goals by carrying out 4 Research Projects and maintaining 4 Core facilities that integrate the research strengths of conventional medicine and CAM practitioners and researchers. ORCCAMIND draws its strength from the multi-institutional support and the quality of all its investigators. The investigators join ORCCCAMIND with extensive experience with clinical trials, patient care, externally funded basic and clinical neuroscience research, and training programs, including federally-funded training grants. ORCCAMIND is a bold initiative that integrates basic and clinical research scientists, conventional neurologists and CAM practitioners. It will promote the exploration of new areas of CAM research and lead research on CAM therapies for neurological disorders. \n",

      " This research will determine whether the Chinese herbal medicine (NPI-028) can make a significant contribution to the management of withdrawal and to follow-up treatment aimed at preventing or managing relapse in both women and men alcoholics. The herbal preparation has been used historically in the treatment of alcohol intoxication and is still prescribed in China and Southeast Asia. Efficacy has been documented but awaits the application of current research methods to establish efficacy, safety, and probable mechanisms of action. Preclinical studies have been carried out in alcohol-preferring rats and vervet monkeys to test efficacy in reducing voluntary alcohol intake, measure tolerance effects, and toxicological affects. The proposed human trial will develop a placebo, establish quality control, test methods of administration, and examine compliance issues. Following these preliminary steps, a placebo controlled trial will be conducted using 160 subjects (80 subjects per treatment condition with 40 of each gender). Alcohol use, craving, health status, psychological status, and at rates will be assessed using established measures that are current in addiction research. \n",

      " Preventing dementia is an important goal for our aging population. This proposal is an initial 42 months study of the effect of standardized ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) on preventing or delaying cognitive decline in people age 85 years or older (the oldest old). The study focuses on the oldest old who present a distinct advantage for primary prevention studies because of their particularly high risk for developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a precursor to dementia. Because this is a population that has previously been out of the mainstream for use of alternative medicine, the safety of GBE in this age group will also be tested in this study. The study is randomized, placebo controlled and double blind. Approximately 200 elderly cognitively healthy subjects will be enrolled and followed for detection of conversion to MCI. This pilot study is viewed as a necessary first step in order to demonstrate that GBE, an alternative or complementary therapy, has a disease modifying effect on the brain, distinct from a symptomatic effect. The study will test the feasibility of the randomized start design, a trial design proposed as a method for discerning brain- or disease- modifying from symptomatic effects. The magnitude of biological effect of the treatments will also be assessed with volumetric quantitative MRI, a complementary means of confirming whether there is a brain modifying effect (measured as a decrease in brain volume loss with treatment). Peripheral markers of oxidation status will measure possible anti-oxidant effects of GBE. \n",

      " The purpose of this study is to investigate novel methods from CAM aimed at alleviating chronic pain related to functional bowel disorders in children. To that end, two CAM modalities will be investigated independently of each other, namely Guided Imagery and the use of Chamomile teas as a form of botanical therapy. Functional abdominal pain is defined as pain unrelated to an identifiable organic gastrointestinal disorder. The two subcategories of functional bowel disorders examined by this study will be RAP and IBS. The definition of RAP in children will follow Apley's classic definition of paroxysmal abdominal pain occurring in children between the ages of 4 and 16 years that persists for more than three months, with a frequency of three or more episodes of abdominal pain over a three month interval. A similar pattern of abdominal pain relieved by defecation and/or associated with altered bowel habits and/or stool consistency will be defined as IBS. Despite the above definitions, note that the typical frequency of pain episodes associated with functional bowel disorders is at least three times per month. \n",
      " Functional bowl disorders are defined as variable combinations of gastrointestinal symptoms that are not readily explained by structural or biochemical abnormalities. In children, these typically encompass irritable bowel syndrome and recurrent abdominal pain of childhood, two closely related disorders that reflect similar pathophysiologic processes. Both of these functional disorders are pervasive in children and possibly precede symptoms that persist into adulthood. These also account for considerable medical expense and morbidity resulting in school absenteeism. Existing therapies are limited, and the lack of success frequently frustrates parents, families, and physicians. The purpose of this pilot project is to explore the use of alternative medicine modalities to treat functional abdominal pain relying on those that address currently accepted pathophysiologic models of functional bowel disorders. Available evidence indicates 3 major mechanisms for these syndromes: altered intestinal motility, altered intestinal sensory thresholds, and psychosocial factors. Recurrent abdominal pain occurs in 10 to 30 percent of children and adolescents, and evidence suggests that many children with recurrent abdominal pain ultimately develop symptoms compatible with irritable bowel syndrome in adulthood. As many as 68% of school children suffering from recurrent abdominal pain have symptoms compatible with the diagnostic criteria for irritable bowel syndrome in adults. Colonic motility studies suggest exaggerated colonic motor function in patients with abdominal pain compared to controls, increased perception of abdominal pain following balloon distention of the rectum, and anxiety and depression compared to healthy children in the community. The approach to therapy including reassurance, fiber, and antispasmodics has not been effective in the long-term management of a recurrent abdominal pain in childhood. Accordingly, this pilot project will attempt to evaluate objectively two alternative modalities that address some of the mechanisms and could offer therapeutic options. In specific aim 1, a randomized controlled trial will be instituted to confirm the effectiveness of relaxation/guided imagery as a modality for treating functional bowel disorders in children and determine if guided imagery improves outcome beyond that achievable using relaxation training alone. In the second trial, the use of chamomile tea as an adjunct to traditional modes of treating functional bowel disorders in children will be assessed and compared to controls who do not receive chamomile tea. The primary outcome will be a reduction in pain measured by a Likert-scale pain inventory using faces as markers. The advantages of this inventory are that faces have been found to be universal across ethnicities and age groups. Secondary outcomes will include bowel habits and stool consistency, measures of functional disability using the Functional Disability Index, and psychiatric profiles using the Child Depression Inventory, Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale, and Children's Global Assessment Scale. In addition, compliance measures will be assessed by phone contact by nurse clinicians. Data management will be undertaken to quantify the analyses already described. \n",

      " This study compares two approaches to the management of acute low back pain: usual care (standard benefit) vs. the choice of: usual care, chiropractic, acupuncture or massage therapy (expanded benefit). 480 subjects with uncomplicated, acute low back pain will be recruited from a health maintenance organization, and randomized to either usual care (n=160) or choice of expanded benefits (n=320). Patients' preferences for individual therapies and expectations of improvement will be measured at baseline and throughout the study. Subjects randomized to the expanded benefits arm who choose chiropractic, acupuncture or massage will receive up to 10 treatments over a five-week period. Additional treatments will be available after the fifth week but will require a copayment. Treatments will be provided by licensed providers who have met strict credentialing criteria. Chiropractic, acupuncture or massage treatments will begin within 48 hours. Chiropractic, acupuncture and massage therapy scope of practice guidelines for the treatment of acute low back pain have been developed as have detailed data tracking procedures to be used at each patient visit. Symptom relief, functional status, restricted activity days, use of health care, and patient and provider satisfaction will be assessed at 2, 5,12, 26 and 52 weeks after initiation of treatment. Primary outcomes will include: 1) change in symptoms; 2) change in functional status; 3) patient satisfaction; and 4) total utilization of services associated with care for low back pain. Medical records and the HMO's cost management information system will identify use of services. It is hypothesized that patients offered their choice of expanded benefits will experience a more rapid improvement in symptoms, a faster return to baseline functional status, a decrease in utilization of conventional medical services, and will be more satisfied with their care. The study is a direct examination of the effectiveness of an insurance eligibility intervention, not a test of the efficacy of specific, non-allopathic treatment regimens. The results of this study will provide valuable information to clinicians, patients and third party payers on the relative benefits and costs of an \"expanded benefits\" treatment option which incorporates chiropractic, acupuncture and massage services for low back pain. \n",

      " Changes in visual attention are common among elders and people with multiple sclerosis. The visual attention changes contribute to difficulty with day to day functioning including falls, driving and even finding one's keys on the kitchen counter as well as contributing to deficits in other cognitive domains. Yoga emphasizes the ability to focus attention and there is some evidence that the practice of yoga may improve one's cognitive abilities. Additionally, yoga practice may improve cognitive function through other non-specific means such as improved mood, decreased stress or declines in oxidative injury. We propose a randomized, controlled 6 month phase II trial of yoga in two separate cohorts: healthy elders and subjects with mild multiple sclerosis. We will determine if yoga intervention produces improvements on a broad attentional battery that especially emphasizes attentional control. To further understand the reported beneficial effect of yoga on its practitioners, we will also determine if there is a positive impact on measures directly related to yoga practice (flexibility and balance) as well as mood, quality of life and oxidative injury markers. The yoga intervention consists of a Hatha yoga class meeting twice per week. The class is taught by experienced yoga teachers who are supervised by a nationally known yoga instructor. There are two control groups. An exercise group will have a structured walking program prescribed by a certified Health and Fitness Instructor and Personal Trainer. The program will attempt to match the Hatha yoga class for metabolic demand. The second control group will be assigned to a 6 month waiting list. The outcome measures are assessed at baseline and after the 6 month period. The primary outcome measures are alertness (quantitative EEG and self-rated scale), ability to focus attention (Stroop) and ability to shift attention (extradimensional set shifting task). Secondary attention outcome measures include the ability to sustain attention (decrement in reaction time) and ability to divide attention (Useful Field of View). Other secondary outcome measures include flexibility, balance, mood, quality of life, fatigue (in MS cohort) and decreased markers of lipid, protein, and DNA oxidative injury. \n",

      " Long-term control of HIV depends on improvement in an individual's immune system. The purpose of this study is to see if either stopping anti-HIV drugs for short periods of time and/or adding a vaccine to the anti-HIV drugs being taken will help to better control HIV infection. The study will test whether these treatment approaches are safe. The HIV vaccine in this study has been tested in people who did not have HIV infection and improved the way their immune system worked. This study will evaluate whether these same immune system changes happen in people with HIV, and, if such changes do occur, assess whether these changes help to improve control of HIV in these patients. \n",
      " The best hope for long-term control of HIV infection in an individual likely rests with the resumption of effective HIV-specific immune responses. Intermittent antiretroviral therapy (ART) withdrawal, as an attempt to \"immunize\" the subject with his/her own active viral quasi-species population, represents an alternative approach to traditional immunization strategies. This study hopes to determine whether intermittent ART withdrawal serves to stimulate HIV-specific immune responses and control of viral replication. This approach will be compared with vaccination with ALVAC-HIV vCP1452. In addition, it is conceivable that intermittent ART withdrawal could boost and broaden the prime response to exogenous vaccine; that will also be studied. Patients will continue receiving their potent ART (not provided by the study) and will be randomly assigned to one of four treatment strategies as follows: Arm A: ALVAC placebo and potent ART for 92 weeks with a single 12- to 20-week therapy withdrawal period; Arm B: ALVAC placebo and potent ART for 84 weeks with a 4- to 6-week therapy withdrawal period, a 4-week therapy withdrawal period, and a 12- to 20-week therapy withdrawal period; Arm C: ALVAC vCP1452 vaccine and potent ART for 92 weeks with a single 12- to 20-week therapy withdrawal period; and Arm D: ALVAC vCP1452 vaccine and potent ART for 84 weeks with a 4- to 6-week therapy withdrawal period, a 4-week therapy withdrawal period, and a 12- to 20-week therapy withdrawal period. Immunizations of placebo or vaccine wil be administered in 3 separate sets of 3 injections per set (9 total) and immunization schedules are the same for all patients, those undergoing intermittent therapy withdrawal (Arms B and D) and those who are not (Arms A and C). This is a multiple-step study. Patients in Arms B and D will receive a 4-week period of potent ART therapy along with the first set of immunizations (Step 1) followed by therapy withdrawal for 4 to 6 weeks (Step 2). Alternating periods of therapy resumption (Step 3, consisting of 16 weeks on potent ART with the second set of vaccine administrations), a second therapy withdrawal (Step 4 for 4 weeks), and another therapy resumption (Step 5, consisting of 16 weeks on potent ART with the third set of vaccine administrations) will follow. Patients in Arms A and C will remain on Step 1 for the first 44 weeks on study. After 44 to 46 weeks on study, patients in all arms will have therapy withdrawn for 12 to 20 weeks (Step 6). Following completion of Step 6, patients whose viral load are below 10,000 copies/ml will be encouraged to remain off potent ART (Step 7) until completion of the study, as long as CD4 T-cell levels remain 50 percent or more of their baseline levels. Participants who successfully complete Step 7 will be invited to enter Step 9, a 48-week optional protocol extension. Otherwise, patients will restart their potent ART regimens (Step 8) and receive virologic and CD4 T-cell monitoring until completion of the study. All patients will be monitored at regular clinic visits. Viral load and CD4 T-cell counts will be measured at each visit. Patients in all arms may participate in substudy A5101s (Male Genital Secretions) or substudy A5137s (Female Genital Secretions), and patients in Arms B and D may participate in substudy A5111s (Latent Infected T-Cell Clearance). \n",

      " We propose to identify patients and families for inclusion in pilot studies of the three modalities. Patients and their families will be asked to participate in these studies. Our research group has done some preliminary work with the modality of hypnotherapy, but has no experience to date with the other two modalities. The idea to try relaxation techniques was generated by the observation that there is great variation in the degree to spasticity at different times in the same patient with CP. When queried, mothers responded that they were able to get their child to relax and decrease the tension in their muscles by stroking, talking softly, and/or by playing certain types of music. The availability of hypnosis and training in self-hypnosis was presented to several families of our patients. Their understanding and acceptance of this alternate therapy was gratifying. The results of this therapy have been promising and have encouraged us to proceed with this modality and to consider making other nonconventional modalities available to our patients.

      " The purpose of this study is to test how the body's immune system responds to the vaccine ALVAC-HIV vCP1452 and to determine if the vaccine is safe when given alone and with MN rgp120. HIV infection and AIDS have no cure, in spite of recent advances in anti-HIV drugs. Many worldwide populations cannot afford the antiviral treatments for infected people. HIV vaccines offer hope for disease prevention. In this trial, 2 experimental HIV vaccines called ALVAC vCP1452 and MN rgp120 will be given to volunteers in Haiti, Brazil, Peru, and Trinidad and Tobago. The study will determine how volunteers' immune systems respond to the vaccines. (This protocol has been changed by adding new international sites.) \n",

      " This study will examine how the herbal remedy ginkgo biloba may affect the body's elimination of other medicines. Many people take ginkgo biloba to improve memory, mental alertness and overall feeling of well being. Since this product is considered a food supplement and not a drug, it is not subject to the rigorous pre-market testing required for prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. As a result, information has not been collected on possible interactions between ginkgo biloba and other medications. This study will look at how ginkgo biloba affects the elimination of phenytoin-a medication used to treat patients with seizures. Normal healthy volunteers 21 years of age or older may be eligible for this 40-day study. Candidates will provide a medical history and undergo a physical examination and routine blood tests. Women of childbearing age must use a reliable form of birth control other than oral contraceptives (\"the pill\"). For at least 2 weeks before the study and throughout its duration, study participants may not have any of the following: 1) medications that can affect platelet function (e.g., aspirin, Motrin, Advil, Nuprin, ibuprofen, etc.); 2) alcoholic beverages; 3) grapefruit and grapefruit juice; and 4) all medications except those given by study personnel. On day 1 of the study, subjects take one 500-mg dose of phenytoin at 8:00 A.M.. On an empty stomach. (Subjects fast the night before taking the phenytoin and are allowed to eat breakfast 2 hours after the dose). Blood samples are drawn just before dosing and again at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 32, 48, 72 and 96 hours after the dose. Blood drawn on this first study day is collected through a catheter (small plastic tube) placed in a vein to avoid multiple needlesticks. After the 12-hour sample is collected, the subject goes home and then returns to the clinic for the remaining blood draws, which are taken by direct needlestick. When the blood sampling is completed, subjects begin ginkgo therapy. The NIH Clinical Center provides participants a supply of 60-mg capsules of ginkgo to take twice a day (at 8 A.M. and 8 P.M..) for 4 weeks.

Eight healthy volunteers will take a single 500mg dose of phenytoin capsules orally with serial blood samples collected over 96 hours for determination of phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Following the pharmacokinetic study subjects will begin taking 2, 60mg capsules (120mg total) of ginkgo twice daily for 28 days. Following 28 days of ginkgo subjects will then again undergo phenytoin pharmacokinetic evaluations with blood samples obtained over 96 hours for determination of phenytoin pharmacokinetics. The ratio of geometric means for phenytoin pharmacokinetic parameter values and 90% confidence intervals about the ratio of log transformed parameter values will be calculated. Confidence intervals falling within the 80-125% range will characterize the pharmacokinetic parameter values before and after ginkgo to be equivalent. \n",

      "Title = Pirfenidone to Treat Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.\n",
      " This study will examine the effectiveness of the drug pirfenidone (Deskar) in improving heart function in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Stiffening of the heart muscle in patients with HCM impairs the heart's ability to relax and thus fill and empty properly. This can lead to heart failure, breathlessness and excessive fatigue. The heart's inability to relax may be due to scarring, or fibrosis, in the muscle wall. This study will test whether pirfenidone can reduce fibrosis, improve heart relaxation and reduce abnormal heart rhythms. Men and women 20 to 75 years old with HCM may be eligible for this study. Participants will undergo a physical examination, blood tests, and other tests and procedures, described below, to assess heart function. When the tests are completed, patients will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. One group will take a pirfenidone capsule and the other will take a placebo (a look-alike pill with no active ingredient) twice a day with meals for 6 months. For the pirfenidone group, the dose of drug will be increased gradually from 400 to 800 milligrams. At the end of 6 months, all patients will repeat the physical examination and heart tests that were done before starting medication. These include: - Electrocardiogram (ECG) - electrodes are attached to the heart to record the heart's electrical activity, providing information on the heartbeat. - Echocardiogram - a probe held against the chest wall uses sound waves to produce images of the heart, providing information on the function of the heart chambers. - 24-hour Holter monitor - a 24-hour recording of the electrical activity of the heart monitors for abnormal heartbeats or conduction abnormalities. - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) - Radiowaves and a strong magnetic field are used to produce images of the heart, providing information on the thickness and movement of the heart muscle. - Radionuclide angiogram - a radioactive tracer is injected into a vein and a special camera is used to scan the heart, providing information on the beating motion of the heart. Scans are obtained at rest and after exercise. - Cardiac (heart) catheterization - a catheter (thin plastic tube) is inserted into a blood vessel in the groin and advanced to the heart to record pressures and take pictures inside the heart. - Electrophysiology study - a catheter is inserted into a blood vessel in the groin and advanced to the heart to record electrical activity, providing information on abnormal heart rhythms. This procedure is done at the time of the heart catheterization. - Cardiac biopsy - a catheter is inserted into a blood vessel in the groin and advanced to the heart to remove a small sample of heart muscle for microscopic examination. This procedure is done at the end of the heart catheterization. \n",
      " Left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction and arrhythmias are important causes of morbidity and mortality in HCM. These abnormalities are believed to be in part due to myocardial fibrosis which frequently complicates HCM. Several studies indicate that pirfenidine can safely inhibit progression or cause regression of fibrotic lesions. We therefore propose to perform a six-month study that examines the ability of pirfenidone to improve LV diastolic dysfunction, exercise performance, and electrophysiologic abnormalities in symptomatic patients with severe HCM. \n",

We also aim to identify genetic factors that contribute to the risk of ALS because individuals with certain genetic traits may be unable to protect against the toxic effects of chemical exposure. Other factors that may protect against the development of ALS, such as dietary antioxidants, are also under investigation.

      " To determine whether retinal arteriolar changes (generalized narrowing, focal narrowing and arterio-venous nicking) and retinopathy were associated with 10-year stroke-and ischemic heart disease-related mortality. \n",
      " BACKGROUND: Blood vessels in the retina of the eye provide a valuable window for evaluating quantitatively small vessel arteriosclerosis (arteriolar narrowing, arterio-venous nicking and arterio-to-venule ratio (AVR)). Previous studies have suggested that these optic fundi vascular parameters may be useful measures of generalized vascular disease and may have important prognostic implications. This study addressed this issue in a quantitative way using an established cohort with previously acquired fundic photographs. The study addressed an important public health problem with findings that may identify at-risk patients who would benefit from earlier intervention. The established cohort was from the Beaver Dam Eye Study cohort, a well-characterized population of predominantly white persons aged 43-86 years at the baseline in 1988-1990. The cohort was originally evaluated in 1988-1990 with routine clinical and laboratory evaluation plus high-quality optic fundi photos. The population had been followed over a 10-year period with identified deaths from ischemic heart disease or stroke. DESIGN NARRATIVE: This was a population-based case-cohort study to determine whether retinal arteriolar changes (generalized narrowing, focal narrowing and arterio-venous nicking) and retinopathy were associated with 10-year stroke-and ischemic heart disease-related mortality. The study population was selected from participants of the Beaver Dam Eye Study, a well-characterized population of predominantly white persons aged 43-86 years at the baseline examination in 1988-90. Cases were defined as participants who had died from either stroke or ischemic heart disease since the baseline examination. Three participants per case were selected from the cohort at baseline as controls, matched on gender and 5-year age intervals to cases. Focal arteriolar narrowing, arteriovenous nicking and retinopathy were graded to baseline using a standardized photographic grading protocol. To evaluate generalized arteriolar narrowing, a method modified from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study was used. Retinal photographs were digitized and processed using a high-resolution scanner. Retinal arteriole and venule widths were then measured with the help of a computer program based on pixel density contrast between the vessel and the background retina. Finally, the average width of the arterioles was summarized as a retinal arteriole to venule ratio (AVR). Standard case-control methodology were applied to calculate the relative odds of association between generalized retinal arteriolar narrowing (using different categories of AVR) and other changes with stroke-and ischemic heart disease-related mortality. Logistic regression models controlling for potential confounders (e.g., blood pressure, serum lipid levels) were employed to evaluate the independent association between retinal arteriolar characteristics and stroke- and ischemic heart disease mortality. \n",

      " To evaluate the trends in the incidence of venous thromboembolism, to determine the risk factors for venous thromboembolism in patients with medical and surgical illness, and to evaluate the efficacy of the anticoagulant therapy in reducing venous thromboembolism. \n",
      " BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) occurs frequently among patients hospitalized for major surgery or hospitalized for a medical illness primarily due to prolonged duration of immobilization. However, many patients undergo major surgery without any occurrence of VTE. Standard prophylactic therapy after surgery is heparin, which reduces the risk of VTE. However, heparin is associated with bleeding complications. Thus, it would be desirable to identify patients at high risk for VTE who might benefit the most from heparin therapy. An important focus of the study is to look at genetic factors which might play an important role in VTE incidence. DESIGN NARRATIVE: The study is a population based, retrospective case and case-control investigation of the genetic and environmental determinants of venous thromboembolism in the Rochester Minnesota Olmsted County population. The first five years of the study had three specific aims. The first specific aim was to update the 1966-1995 inception cohort to include Olmsted County residents with VTE during the five year period, 1996-2000. The second aim was to extend the analysis of risk factors for VTE by identifying two Olmsted County residents (controls) without VTE matched by age and gender to each definite or probable case within the 1996-2000 cohort, and to obtain plasma and genomic DNA from all cases and controls and perform a case-control study. The third specific aim was to evaluate the efficacy of anticoagulant therapy to prevent VTE recurrence. The study was extended through March, 2009 to investigate trends in the incidence of venous thromboembolism, new risk factors including lipid-lowering, beta-blocker, and ACE-inhibitor therapies, and introduction of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) therapy. \n",

      " To investigate the effects of different amounts of exercise on both cardiorespiratory fitness and risk factors for cardiovascular disease in sedentary, overweight, mildly hypertensive, but healthy, postmenopausal women aged 45 to 75 years. \n",
      " BACKGROUND: The primary goal of the Dose-Response to Exercise in Women aged 45-75 Years (DREW) was to investigate the effects of different amounts of exercise on both cardiorespiratory fitness and risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Participants were sedentary, overweight or obese, postmenopausal women who had high normal blood pressure or Stage I hypertension, and thus are at moderately high risk for cardiovascular disease. A total of 464 women (about 35% were recruited from minority groups) were randomly assigned to a control group (N = 102) or to 1 of 3 exercise groups (N = 155 for the lowest exercise dose and 104 in the 8-kcal/kg group and 103 in the 12-kcal/kg exercise group). Women assigned to the exercise groups exercised for 6 months at energy expenditures of 4, 8, or 12 kcal ·kg-1 · week-1. These exercise doses represent the consensus public health recommendation for physical activity from recently published guidelines from the U.S. Public Health Service, American Heart Association, and American College of Sports Medicine (8 kcal ·kg-1 · week-1) and at doses 50% below (4 kcal ·kg-1 · week-1) and 50% above (12 kcal ·kg-1 · week-1) the consensus dose. All women exercised at 50% of V02 max. The exercise sessions took place in the exercise laboratory, with individual supervision of each session and strict control of frequency, duration, and intensity. This was provided thorough documentation of the exact amount of exercise completed. Primary outcome measures are VO2 max and resting systolic blood pressure. Other cardiovascular disease risk factors, psychosocial variables, health-related quality of life, body composition, and fat distribution are secondary outcomes. Other secondary analyses included a focus on the extent to which observed dose-response effects are modified by baseline levels of fitness, ethnicity, risk factors, or age. Assessments will take place at baseline and 6 months. The research provided information about (1) patterns of change in outcomes produced by each of several exercise doses, (2) whether performing exercise at less than the current consensus dose has any benefit, (3) whether performing more exercise than the consensus dose has greater (or proportionally greater) health benefits, and (4) the characteristics of sedentary women who are most likely to benefit from various exercise doses. DESIGN NARRATIVE: A total of 464 sedentary, postmenopausal women at moderate risk for cardiovascular disease was randomly assigned to receive exercise training at one of three doses (4, 8, or 12 kcal/kg/wk) or no exercise for six months duration. The specific aims were be to determine: (a) if women in the exercise groups have increased aerobic power (VO2max) over the six months compared to the no exercise group; (b) if women in the exercise groups have a greater reduction in resting systolic blood pressure than those in the no exercise group; and, (c) if there will be a dose-response gradient across the three exercise groups for changes in aerobic power and systolic blood pressure. Secondary aims include evaluating the effects of exercise dose on fasting blood lipids and lipoproteins, glucose, insulin, anthropometry, self-reported quality of life, and cardiovascular risk as determined by a multiple logistic risk function. Covariates to be controlled included dietary intake, physical activity (outside of the exercise program), smoking, alcohol intake, sleep habits, medication use (including hormone replacement therapy), demographics, menstrual history, personal and family medical history. \n",

      " BACKGROUND: MRFIT was initiated in 1972 as a randomized, multicenter primary prevention trial designed to determine whether a special intervention consisting of smoking cessation, cholesterol reduction and control of high blood pressure, would result in a significant reduction in coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality, compared to usual care. Follow-up and analysis has continued on the 361,662 men screened and the 12,866 men randomized. DESIGN NARRATIVE: The National Death Index (NDI) will be used for continued follow-up of the MRFIT cohorts. An additional assay to establish IGF-1 and IGF binding protein will be added to the data set as a potential prognostic factor. The effort will focus on three primary aims related to long-term mortality. Aim 1 will relate nutritional-dietary data to twenty-five year mortality from coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, cardiovascular disease (CVD), colon cancer, prostate cancer, and all causes for the 12,866 men randomized. Aim 2 will relate age, ethnicity, socioeconomic position, geographic location, major risk factors, low risk status, prior diabetes, and prior myocardial infarction to twenty-five year mortality for the 361,662 men screened. Aim 3 will relate insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), IGF binding protein, and fasting and one-hour glucose measurements from frozen baseline sera to mortality for the 12,866 men randomized. \n",

      "Title = Study and Surgical Treatment of Syringomyelia.\n",
      " The goal of this study is to establish the mechanism(s) of progression of primarily spinal syringomyelia (PSS). Our preliminary study of syringomyelia emphasized syringomyelia associated with craniocervical junction abnormalities (CCJAS), such as the Chiari I malformation. This new protocol will expand the scope of our investigation to include primarily spinal syringomyelia (PSS), which is defined as syringomyelia not associated with craniocervical junction abnormalities (CCJAS). Etiologies of primarily spinal syringomyelia include 1) intradural scarring which is post-traumatic, post-inflammatory, or post-operative, 2) intradural-extramedullary masses such as arachnoid cysts or meningiomas, and 3) extramedullary-extradural spinal lesions such as cervical spondylosis or spinal deformity. Our hypothesis is the following: Primarily spinal syringomyelia (PSS), results from obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow within the spinal subarachnoid space; this obstruction affects spinal CSF dynamics because the spinal subarachnoid space accepts the fluid that is displaced from the intracranial subarachnoid space as the brain expands during cardiac systole; in the case of primarily spinal syringomyelia (PSS), a subarachnoid block effectively shortens the spinal subarachnoid space, reducing CSF compliance and the capacity of the spinal theca to dampen the subarachnoid CSF pressure waves produced by the brain expansion during cardiac systole; the exaggerated spinal subarachnoid pressure waves occur with every heartbeat and act on the spinal cord above the block to drive CSF into the spinal cord and create a syrinx. Presyringomyelia, a recently described state of spinal cord edema associated with progressive myelopathy and obstruction in CSF flow, is a precursor stage to syringomyelia that is consistent with this hypothesis. Because of the importance of this condition to the pathophysiology of syringomyelia, we will also study patients with presyringomyelia in this protocol. After a syrinx is formed, the enlarged subarachnoid pressure waves compress the external surface of the spinal cord, propel the syrinx fluid, and promote syrinx progression. Many neurosurgeons at prominent academic centers routinely use syrinx shunts to treat primarily spinal syringomyelia. This study should provide data that a surgical procedure that opens the spinal subarachnoid space corrects the underlying pathophysiology and resolves the syrinx and that invasion of the spinal cord is unnecessary. \n",
      " Objective: The goal of this study is to establish the mechanism(s) of progression of primarily spinal syringomyelia (PSS), the type of syringomyelia that is associated with pathology in the spinal column and not at the craniocervical junction. Our hypothesis is that when a lesion obstructs the spinal subarachnoid space, it shortens the segment of spinal canal that dampens the CSF pressure waves that are produced with each heartbeat and creates enlarged spinal subarachnoid pressure waves that act on the spinal cord above the block to drive CSF into the spinal cord and create a syrinx. After a syrinx is formed, enlarged subarachnoid pressure waves compress the external surface of the spinal cord, propel the syrinx fluid, and promote syrinx progression. Study Population: Subjects will have primary spinal syringomyelia associated with 1) intradural scarring which is post-traumatic, post-inflammatory, or post-operative, 2) intradural-extramedullary masses such as arachnoid cysts or meningiomas, and 3) extramedullary-extradural spinal lesions such as cervical spondylosis or spinal deformity, or 4) an intramedullary tumor. Design: Subjects will have testing before and after standard surgical therapy of syringomyelia. Testing includes measurement of CSF pressure, neurologic examination, CT-myelography, and MR scanning. Results of CSF pressure measurements before surgery will be compared to measurements from normal controls that were previously studied. The effect of surgery on CSF pressure, neurologic examination, CT-myelography, and MRI scans will be evaluated. Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure is cervical CSF pulse pressure, which is the amplitude of the CSF pressure wave, compared to normal values. Secondary outcomes measures include change in CSF pulse pressure, neurologic examination, CT-myelography, and MRI scans between before and after surgery. \n",

The prevalence and progression of carotid atherosclerosis are believed to be influenced by genetically inherited variations in lipoprotein metabolism.

Both paraoxonase activity and genotype will be determined and compared between groups. The results may eventually make it possible to screen for a paraoxonase allele that confers high risk of atherosclerosis, and to diminish the risk by early treatment. Study Abstract: The general aim of the proposed research is to evaluate the contribution and mechanism of paraoxonase (PON1) genotypic and phenotypic variation (PON1 status) in risk and progression of carotid artery disease (CAAD). We propose to study moderately affected individuals currently being enrolled in a longitudinal, 3-year magnetic resonance imaging (MR) study to evaluate components of MR image as predictors of CAAD progression. We will study the role of PON1 in CAAD progression in this cohort. We will also collect age-, sex-, race-, and hospital- matched controls, to test hypotheses related to the presence or absence of CAAD. We plan to consider the complex genetic architecture of both vascular disease and PON1 effects in vascular disease. In addition to evaluating known paraoxonase (PON1) polymorphisms, we will evaluate PON1 hydrolysis phenotypes. We have shown that these intervening phenotypes can be superior to known genotypes in CAAD prediction. We will also evaluate PON1 polymorphisms that we have recently detected and shown to affect PON1 expression, as well as consider haplotype effects. The specific aims are to: 1) test for PON1 effects in CAAD progression evaluated by 3 year magnetic resonance image follow-up of percent lumen stenosis; 2) test for PON1 effects in moderate CAAD vs. control prediction, including independence of PON1 from traditional cardiovascular risk factors; and 3) evaluate the possible mechanisms of PON1's association with carotid artery disease, specifically PON1's relationship with the susceptibility of LDL to oxidation and variation in LDL density. Two paraoxonase (PON1) polymorphisms, PON1-Q192R and PON1-L55M have been inconsistently associated with vascular disease. However, plasma PON1 activity phenotypes vary markedly within genotypes. Thus, activity was expected to add to the informativeness of genotype for predicting vascular disease. The case-control study included 212 age and race matched men with mean age 66.4 yr. (range 49-82 yr.); 95% were Caucasian. The 106 carotid artery disease (CAAD) cases had >80% carotid stenosis and the 106 controls had <15% stenosis. Two PON1 substrate hydrolysis rates (paraoxon, POase; diazoxon, DZOase) were significantly lower in cases than in controls and were significant predictors of CAAD using logistic regression (POase, p=0.005, 25% reduced; DZOase, p=0.019, 16% reduced). POase and DZOase were both significant when included in the same model. DZOase predicted vascular disease independently of lipoprotein profile, HDL subfractions, apoAI, and smoking. The marginal effects of PON1-192 (p=0.75) and PON1-55 (p=0.83) genotypes or haplotype (0.70) did not predict case-control status. However, when phenotype was included as a predictor both PON1-192 and PON1-55 genotypes or haplotypes were significant predictors at the 0.05 level. The common methodology of examining PON1-192 and/or PON1-55 genotypes alone may lead to the erroneous conclusion that there is no PON1 role in CAAD. This may have broad implications for the utility of the \"genotype only\" approach. These results support the benefit of a \"level crossing\" approach that includes intervening phenotypes in the study of complexly inherited disease \n",

      " White blood cells can cause liver damage if they inappropriately accumulate in the liver in large numbers. Such an event can occur if an individual's blood is exposed to endotoxin, a substance released from the cell walls of many species of bacteria. The purpose of this study is to isolate neutrophils, an important white blood cell, from the blood of normal volunteers, and put them in tissue culture with isolated liver cells. The experiments will determine how endotoxin can increase the ability of neutrophils to damage liver cells. All studies supported by this grant will be done with isolated cells in tissue culture. This experimental model will reveal possible mechanisms that can in the future be evaluated in human diseases such as bacterial sepsis. \n",
      " Neutrophils will be isolated from normal human volunteers and placed in cell culture with isolated hepatocytes or C3A cells (hepatoblastoma cell line that exhibit many characteristics of normal hepatocytes). These experiments will evaluate the mechanisms by which neutrophil adhere to the surface of hepatocytes, and the mechanisms by which the attached neutrophils can damage or kill the hepatocytes. Mechanisms of adhesion will involve understanding of the chemokines released by the hepatocytes that stimulate neutrophil adhesiveness, the cytokines that activate hepatocytes to express chemokines and adhesion molecules, the adhesion receptors on the neutrophil surface that are able to recognize the adhesion molecules on the hepatocyte surface, and the ability of adhesion to enhance and focus cytotoxic chemicals coming from the stimulated neutrophils. In addition, the role endotoxin can play in these sequence of events is being studies, and the specific cytotoxic mechanisms released by the neutrophils are under study. As noted in the brief summary, this grant only supports use of human cells in vitro (i.e., all experiments will be done in tissue culture). The purpose of working with this experimental model is to define what mechanisms should in future experiments be evaluated in patients with endotoxin induced disease. \n",

A repeated measurement study is being performed on acute boilermakers (apprentices and journeymen). A stratified analysis is then done on those with and without chronic bronchitis, after adjustment for relevant covariates. \n",
      " Population-based epidemiologic studies of communities in the United States have revealed a consistent association between ambient particulate air pollution and increases in morbidity and mortality. The observed increases result from both respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Similar associations have been observed for rates of hospital admissions for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases for subjects over age 65. These ambient exposures are to low levels of particulates, many times lower than occupational exposures faced by workers in a variety of industries, including manufacturing, construction, transportation and electric-power generation. The objective of this proposal is to investigate the role of occupational exposure to particulates in the development of respiratory and cardiac responses in boilermakers. We will employ a detailed, continuous-exposure assessment to PM2.5 with repeated measures of biologic and physiologic markers of response. Specific hypotheses to be tested will include: (1) occupational exposure to fuel-oil ash particulates induce airway inflammation as reflected in increased expired NO, and airflow obstruction as reflected in decreases in peak flow (PEFR) and FEV1; (2) particulate exposure will result in acute changes in cardiovascular function, as reflected in changes in heart rate, heart-rate variability and blood pressure; (3) particulate exposures result in increased serum fibrinogen levels, a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease; and (4) chronic bronchitis predisposes particulate-exposed workers to changes in cardiac function. The results of this study will have important implications for preventive efforts aimed at reducing morbidity and mortality from occupational exposure to respirable particulates. \n",

      " The goals of this project are to establish a new cohort of male veterans and describe associations between potential risk factors and baseline bone mineral density (BMD) as well as rates of BMD loss. \n",
      " Primary Hypothesis: Risk factors such as smoking, alcohol, and caffeine are associated with osteoporosis in men. Intervention: None Primary Outcomes: Percent reduction in cross-sectional bone mineral density over time. Study Abstract: The goals of this project are to establish a new cohort of male veterans and describe associations between potential risk factors and baseline bone mineral density (BMD) as well as rates of BMD loss. The study is a two-year observational prospective study of 1000 male veterans aged 50 and older. The subjects are drawn from two existing VA cohorts, the Normative Aging Study (NAS) and the Veterans Health Study (VHS). Examinations to be performed on each subject (baseline and two follow-up exams) include BMD measurement at the hip, forearm and total body, anthropometry, hand grip strength, and questionnaires on current diet, physical activity, tobacco, alcohol use, sunlight exposure, health related quality of life (Medical Outcomes Study Short Form), depression (Brief Depression Scale), fracture history, medications and psychological factors (PrimeMD, MiniMental). Additional data on historical exposure to risk factors, previously obtained in the NAS or VHS studies, will also be correlated with BMD and BMD loss. Multivariate linear and logistic models with control for potential confounders will be used in the main analyses. Examinations take place at the Boston VA Outpatient Clinic. Examinations on each subject include BMD measurement at the hip, forearm and total body, height and weight, hand grip strength, leg extensor strength, and mobility. Questionnaires on current diet, physical activity, tobacco, alcohol use, sunlight exposure, health related quality of life (Medical Outcomes Study Short Form), depression (Brief Depression Scale), fracture history, medications and psychological factors (PrimeMD, MiniMental) are administered. Each subject also contributes a nonfasting blood sample and a 24-hour urine sample. Beginning in April, 1999, two additional measures are being obtained as a result of a 4-year supplemental VA Epidemiology grant awarded to Dr. Miller. These are the heel ultrasound measure and a 4-day physical activity level determined by ambulatory monitor. Preliminary cross-sectional analysis of mean BMD for femoral neck, total body and forearm BMD suggest the percent reduction in cross-sectional BMD between ages 60-69 and 80-89 is approximately 9% per decade at the femoral neck, 5%/decade at the total body, and 8%/decade at the forearm. These age-related patterns agree well with other studies of BMD in older men. The x-ray densitometer was installed at the Boston VA Outpatient Clinic in April, 1998 and the study technician was certified for bone density measurements during the three-day training session that followed. A precision study was conducted in the following month. In vivo reproducibility was determined by performing 5 repeat scans of each of the three sites on 5 volunteers ranging in age from 21 to 50 years. Subjects were repositioned between each scan. The coefficient of variation (CV) of femoral neck BMD in our laboratory is 0.92%; for whole body BMD, 0.72%; and for distal radius BMD, 1.04%. An aluminum spine phantom with known density (1.254 gm/cm2) is scanned every two weeks on the DPX-IQ. The mean ? standard deviation of 15 measurements is 1.250 ? 0.0058, coefficient of variation = 0.46%. There has been no detectable drift in phantom values during the study start-up phase. When completed, this study will be one of the largest in the US to study risk factors for osteoporosis in men, historically an understudied group in relation to osteoporosis. Several of the hypothesized risk factors (smoking, alcohol, caffeine, for example) are amenable to change and represent potential areas of intervention. Thus, not only can the VA make a valuable contribution to furthering our understanding of osteoporosis in men in general, but strategies may be identified to reduce morbidity as well as reduce health care costs associated with fracture in the elderly. \n",

      " Primary Objectives: Determine the association between level of spinal cord injury (SCI) with chronic respiratory symptoms, measures of pulmonary function, and respiratory illness, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Intervention: None Study Abstract: This study is using a standardized method to assess respiratory function in SCI in order to determine the association between level of SCI with chronic respiratory symptoms, measures of pulmonary function, and respiratory illness, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. A community-based mail survey was made of 1147 subjects (42% response rate; 2 mailings, n=485). Additional subjects injured >1 year ago underwent testing at the West Roxbury VAMC (FVC, FEV1, TLC and subdivisions, maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures (MIP/MEP), and completed a health questionnaire based on the ATS DL-78 respiratory questionnaire. Between 10/94-9/98, a cross-sectional cohort of 361 subjects with chronic SCI were tested. Multiple logistic regression was used to examine predictors of respiratory symptoms and chest illness determined from the questionnaire. From the community-based mail survey, SCI with complete cervical injury (CC) the odds reporting ?any wheeze? relative to lower SCI levels (odds ratio (95%CI)) was 3.34 (1.75-6.40), p<0.001, and for ?persistent wheeze? was 2.41 (1.11-5.22), p=0.023. The odds of reporting chronic cough or phlegm were not increased (p=0.40 and 0.07 respectively). Active cigarette smoking was the strongest predictor of respiratory symptoms. In a subset of subjects tested at our VAMC, the odds of CC SCI of reporting chest illness resulting in time off work, indoors at home, or in bed over 3 years before questionnaire completion relative to incomplete injury was 3.00 (1.12-8.01), p=0.029. For 1 PPD current smokers the risk of chest illness was 3.91 (1.71-8.95), p=0.001, for subjects who smoked post injury but quit within the previous 10 years the odds was 3.00 (1.00-8.97), p=0.05. For other former smokers the odds were not significantly increased. Subjects who reported ?persistent wheeze? were nearly 3 times as likely to have reported a chest illness (p=0.036). After using a wheelchair, 31% of CC subjects reported breathlessness, compared to 15% with complete high thoracic, and 11% of lower injuries (p=0.04 trend). Subjects who were not wheelchair athletes, even when lung function and SCI level were noted, were twice as likely not to report breathlessness compared to athletes (p=0.032). Subjects with SCI were able to produce reproducible spirometry. Analysis of the effect of SCI level on lung function is in progress, as are analyses examining predictors of chest illness in the workers tested to date. We have developed a method to assess respiratory function in SCI. Using these methods, complete cervical SCI have been found to experience more wheeze and breathlessness than others with SCI, and are more likely to report a chest illness. However, active cigarette smoking was the most important predictor of chest illness and respiratory symptoms rather than injury level or completeness. Therefore, it is likely that SCI based smoking cessation programs would result in significantly reducing respiratory morbidity in this population. The introduction of exercise programs might also result in a decreased prevalence of breathlessness in complete cervical SCI. \n",

      " Primary Objective: Evaluate risk factors which predict the transformation of early stage to clinically aggressive disease. Intervention: None Study Abstract: Environmental factors such as diet and cigarette smoking may play a role in predicting the progression of early stage prostate cancer to advance disease. The goal of this project is to establish an observational cohort of patients with early stage prostate cancer who elect not to undergo radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy to evaluate risk factors which predict the transformation of early stage to clinically aggressive disease. A total of 1,000 US male veterans with early stage prostate cancer will be recruited to participate in the study. In order to maximize African-American participation, VA medical centers that serve large minority populations will be utilized for recruitment. Eligible participants must have an early stage prostate cancer diagnosis (T0-T2) with no known involved lymph nodes or metastases, and no prior history of cancer (with the exception of nonmelanoma skin cancer) or other major illness that would preclude long term participation. Individuals willing to participate will be administered a lifestyle questionnaire and a dietary assessment. The lifestyle survey ascertains baseline demographics, mode of cancer diagnosis, medical history, smoking, family history of prostate cancer, alcohol use, level of physical activity, and other potential risk factors for prostate cancer progression. Nutritional parameters will be measured through a self-administered, semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. A blood specimen will also be collected for genetic and biochemical research. Participants will be followed annually with additional lifestyle and dietary questionnaires. Both surveys are currently being tested through a pilot project in a population of prostate cancer survivors to assess the feasibility of collecting diet and lifestyle data in veterans and to refine the study methods and recruitment strategies (the current versions of the surveys are included). A pilot study is being conducted to test different survey types and mailing techniques. The results from the pilot project will help improve the survey methodology and refine the survey research tools to accurately assess dietary and lifestyle factors. Lifestyle surveys have been created to ascertain baseline demographics and potential risk factors for prostate cancer survival and progression. Two versions have been generated to test participant response to varying survey lengths (a short form vs. a long form). The initial mailing of the lifestyle and dietary surveys was directed to 836 veterans diagnosed with prostate cancer in the Boston VA Healthcare Network (ICD-9 code in patient treatment files). Surveys were sent to 132 African-American veterans, 342 white veterans, and 362 veterans with no known race. An Access database has been developed to track survey response and blood collection sites have been established in VA health facilities in the Boston area. A phone tracking system has been established to answer participants questions about the survey. A total of 251 (30%) of the veterans completed the surveys and 72% agreed to provide blood samples. The response rate was 11% for African-Americans, 28% for whites, and 27% for unknown race. Follow-up mailings are currently being sent to veterans who didn't respond to the initial survey request. A telephone survey is being designed to target African-American non-responders to improve survey response in this cohort. Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men and the second most common cause of cancer deaths among men in the United States. Counseling patients with early stage disease about treatment options is extremely difficult since the relative benefit of different approaches is not known. The evidence to date indicates that there is no clear benefit with invasive intervention over watchful waiting. In addition, little is known about risk factors which predict the transformation of early stage prostate cancer to clinically aggressive disease. This is of particular concern in the VA since more than a third of all veterans are over age 65. The ability to differentiate individuals with early stage prostate cancer from those with disease that will become clinically aggressive would have enormous benefits. It would help allay the anxiety of those with indolent disease and potentially reduce the morbidity and mortality of those with disease likely to become clinically aggressive. \n",

      " Infants who are on breathing support are often treated with steroids (dexamethasone); however, the best timing of therapy is not known. This trial looked at the benefits and hazards of starting dexamethasone therapy at two weeks of age and four weeks of age in premature infants. \n",
      " Ventilator-dependent premature infants are often treated with dexamethasone. However, the optimal timing of therapy is unknown. We compared the benefits and hazards of initiating dexamethasone therapy at two weeks of age and at four weeks of age in 371 ventilator-dependent very-low-birth-weight infants (501 to 1500 grams) who had respiratory-index scores (mean airway pressure x the fraction of inspired oxygen) of greater than or equal 2.4 at two weeks of age. The primary outcome was the number of days from randomization to extubation not requiring reintubation (extubation score or death). The secondary outcomes were death before discharge from the hospital; the duration of assisted ventilation, supplementary oxygen therapy and hospital stay; the incidence of chronic lung disease (defined as the need for supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks postconceptional age by best obstetrical estimate) and rates of morbidity and mortality from respiratory causes during the first year. Additional secondary endpoints were hyperglycemia, hypertension, growth, bacteremia, necrotizing enterocolitis and upper GI bleeding. The sample size of 370 was based on a 0.60 probability that the extubation score of late treatment was greater than early treatment, a 5% two-sided type 1 error, 85% power, and 10% treatment noncompliance. Infants were randomized to either receive dexamethasone for two weeks followed by saline placebo for two weeks, or saline placebo for two weeks followed by either dexamethasone or additional placebo for two weeks (if they still met entry criteria). Dexamethasone was given at a dose of 0.25 mg per kilogram of body weight twice daily intravenously or orally for five days, and the dose then tapered. The median time to ventilator independence was 36 days in the dexamethasone-placebo group and 37 days in the placebo-dexamethasone group. The incidences of chronic lung disease (defined as the need for oxygen supplementation at 36 weeks postconceptional age) were 66 percent and 67 percent, respectively. Dexamethasone was associated with an increased incidence of nosocomial bacteremia (relative risk, 1.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 2.1) and hyperglycemia (relative risk, 1.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.2 to 3.0) in the dexamethasone-placebo group, elevated blood pressure (relative risk, 2.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.2 to 6.9) in the placebo-dexamethasone group, and diminished weight gain and head growth (P less than 0.001) in both groups. Treatment of ventilator-dependent premature infants with dexamethasone at two weeks of age is more hazardous and no more beneficial than treatment at four weeks of age. \n",

      "Title = Rolipram to Treat Multiple Sclerosis.\n",
      " This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and effect of the drug Rolipram on multiple sclerosis (MS). It will examine whether Rolipram can dampen the part of the immune response believed to lead to MS and reduce disease activity. Patient with multiple sclerosis who are between the ages of 18 and 65 may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a complete neurological and medical evaluation. Participants will complete three study phases-baseline, treatment and follow-up, as follows: Baseline (3 months) - Approximately four magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans will be obtained to assess MS activity. Participants with MS activity above a certain level will continue with the treatment phase. Treatment (8 months) - Patients will take Rolipram tablets in increasing doses every 2 to 3 days for the first month of this phase until their individual maximum tolerated dose is established. Dosing will continue at that level for the rest of the treatment phase. Dosing is in the morning, midday and evening. Patients will be seen monthly in the clinic for examination and MRI scans. Follow-up - Participants will have monthly exams and MRIs for 3 months following the treatment phase, after which their participation in the study ends. Patients' monthly visits during treatment and follow-up include a neurological examination to assess disease status; MRI to assess brain changes; and blood and urine collection to monitor liver, kidney and other functions. In addition, a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) is done during the last month of the baseline phase and one month after treatment ends to study changes in the spinal fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord, and leukapheresis is done once during the last month of the baseline phase and once during the last month of treatment to collect white blood cells for study. These procedures involve the following: MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves instead of X-rays to produce images showing structural and chemical changes in tissues. The patient lies on a table in a narrow cylinder (the scanner) containing a magnetic field and images are taken. A contrast agent called gadolinium is injected into a vein during the last set of images to help identify new lesions. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which is similar to MRI, is also done once during the baseline phase, at 4 months and at 8 months to measure brain chemicals. For the spinal tap, a local anesthetic is given and a needle is inserted in the space between the bones (vertebrae) in the lower back. About 2 tablespoons of fluid is collected through the needle. For leukapheresis, whole blood is collected through a needle placed in an arm vein. The blood circulates through a machine that separates it into its components. The white cells are removed and the red cells, platelets and plasma are returned to the body through a second needle placed in the other arm. Patients may also have studies to measure levels of Rolipram in the blood. These are done on study days 1 and 29 and at months 2, 4, and 6. For days 1 and 29, a catheter is placed in an arm vein and 4 ml. of blood is drawn immediately before the morning dose and at several intervals from 20 minutes to 6 hours after the dose. For the other tests, a single 4-ml sample is collected before the noon dose. \n",
      " Rolipram is a phosphodiesterase (PDE) type 4 inhibitor that has originally been developed by Schering AG, Berlin, Germany, as an antidepressant, before others and our laboratory documented the immunomodulatory properties of the drug. In the current trial, Rolipram will for the first time be tested as a novel immunomodulatory therapy in multiple sclerosis patients. The protocol involves a stage I for finding the highest individually well-tolerated drug dose, before stage II, and 8 months treatment period with this individually well-tolerated dose, will be conducted. The trial shall document the safety, tolerability an efficacy with respect to inhibition of central nervous inflammation in multiple sclerosis patients. Magnetic resonance imaging and clinical examinations will be used to study the above parameters, and immunological studies that will be conducted in parallel to the trial, will address the mechanism of action of Rolipram in MS. \n",

      "Title = Reproductive Effects of Pesticide, PCB and Mercury Exposure in Laotian Immigrants.\n",
      " This project is examining the reproductive effects of exposure to certain compounds that are suspected to act on the endocrine system, e.g. they may act like or interfere with hormones such as estrogen. The study is being conducted among Laotian women, as it is suspected that they may have higher exposures to the compounds of interest (pesticides and PCBs) from their homeland and from consumption of fish caught in the San Francisco Bay. Fifty Laotian immigrants were recruited by community workers to collect urine daily during 3 menstrual cycles for measurement of steroid hormones (estrogen and progesterone). Additionally, they provided a blood sample to measure exposure levels, and completed 2 interviews in their native language. These measured levels, as well as the self-reported data on a number of factors including fish consumption, will be examined for possible effects on hormone levels and menstrual function. \n",
      " We are conducting a study to examine whether women who have been exposed to chlorinated pesticides or PCBs have alterations in their ovarian function as measured by the frequency of menstrual cycle disturbances. Such disturbances may impact the frequency of infertility and sub-fertility, as well as that of other hormone-dependent illnesses such as breast cancer and osteoporosis. The target population is a group of Laotian immigrants who are frequent consumers of fish caught locally in the San Francisco Bay. Contaminant levels above health protective advisories have been documented in Bay fish and shellfish for a number of these substances. Immigration from Asia, as well as consumption of contaminated fish, have been shown to be associated with higher organochlorine pesticide body burdens. Exposure is determined by measuring serum levels of a panel of pesticide metabolites, including those of DDT, chlordane, hepatochlor and others, as well as PCB congeners. In addition, mercury levels are measured in the blood. Menstrual function is assessed by measuring urinary metabolites of steroid hormones daily during three menstrual cycles of 50 Laotian women of reproductive age. The participants were also asked to complete two detailed in-person interviews about various factors, including fish consumption. We previously conducted a study of menstrual function in a group of 400 women during which we developed algorithms to determine ovulatory status, day of ovulation and menstrual cycle disturbances such as short luteal phase that can also be applied to the new sample. This previously collected sample (or the Asians therein) will serve as a baseline comparison group for the current sample. In addition, it will provide a source of data on the effects of lifestyle (such as smoking and alcohol consumption) and demographic (such as age and ethnicity) factors on menstrual function, allowing for more efficient examination of a small group of exposed women in the current study. In addition to serum organochlorine levels, questionnaire measures of exposure (e.g. species-specific fish consumption, occupational exposure and previous residence) will be examined in relation to ovarian function defined as continuous measures (e.g. cycle length, steroid conjugate levels) and dichotomous abnormalities (e.g. short luteal phase or anovulation). At this time all data collection is complete, hormones measured and analyses begun. In working with this refugee, lower socioeconomic status community we adopted a model of participatory research. Steps were taken to develop partnerships with various community organizations. Staff who spoke one of the three prominent dialects (Mien, Lao, or Khmu ) were hired from the local community and provided with training to present information about reproductive and environmental health to the community. Participants were compensated for their time, as well as being provided with educational materials about reproductive health, safe consumption of seafood and their own results. \n",

      "Title = Phase I Trial of Tariquidar (XR9576) in Combination With Doxorubicin, Vinorelbine, or Docetaxel in Pediatric Patients With Solid Tumors.\n",
      " This study will evaluate the tolerance and effects of tariquidar, given in combination with one of three anticancer drugs, for treating solid tumors. Tariquidar works by blocking a pump on a cancer cell. The pump on a cell that prevents anticancer drugs from accumulating is called Pgp (P-glycoprotein). Researchers hope to see whether cancer-fighting drugs can stay in the cells longer. Patients ages 2 to 18 who have solid tumors may be eligible for this study. Tariquidar is infused intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes, given every 21 to 28 days, with one drug that kills cancer cells. Patients are examined by a doctor at least once weekly during treatment and will have routine blood tests twice weekly. They will receive one of the following drugs with tariquidar: doxorubicin (Adriamycin ), vinorelbine (Navelbine ), or docetaxel (Taxotere ). At the first treatment cycle only, there is a baseline Sestamibi scan before treatment and a second one immediately after drug administration. If patients receive tariquidar with doxorubicin, tariquidar is given alone. Then 48 to 72 hours later, the second dose is given, followed by doxorubicin by IV over 15 minutes. Dexrazoxane, which decreases damaging effects of doxorubicin on the heart, is also given by IV over 15 minutes. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is injected daily 48 hours after doxorubicin, to alleviate doxorubicin s effect on white blood cells. If patients receive tariquidar with vinorelbine, tariquidar is given alone. Then 48 to 72 hours later, the second dose is given, immediately followed by vinorelbine by IV over 10 minutes; then 1 week later, tariquidar is again given, immediately followed by vinorelbine by IV for 10 minutes. G-CSF is given daily. If patients receive tariquidar with docetaxel, tariquidar is given alone. Then 48 to 72 hours later, the second dose is given, followed by docetaxel by IV over 60 minutes. Drugs to prevent allergic reactions are given before and after each docetaxel dose. G-CSF is given daily. Tariquidar may affect blood pressure during infusion, and there can be reduction of normal blood cells, gastrointestinal problems, and allergic reactions. The radioactive Sestamibi can cause headache, chest pain, and nausea. Radiation used in this study has been approved as involving a slightly greater than minimal risk for adults and an acceptable risk for children. This radiation is considered necessary to obtain information desired. One possible effect is a slight increase in the risk of cancer. This study may or may not have a direct benefit for participants. However, knowledge gained may benefit people with cancer in the future. \n",
      " Background: - Pgp is a 170 kDa plasma membrane glycoprotein that functions as a non-specific energy-dependent drug efflux pump. Pgp is expressed in a variety of normal human tissues, such as renal proximal tubules, capillary endothelial cells that comprise the blood-brain barrier, epithelial cells lining the bile canaliculi, bone marrow stem cells, and peripherial blood mononuclear cells. - Pgp over-expression in tumor cells results in a multidrug resistance phenotype by preventing the intracellular accumulation of a variety of chemotherapeutic agents, including anthracyclines, taxanes, vinca alkyloids, and epipodophyllotoxins. Inhibition of Pgp may partially reverse multidrug resistance by increasing intracellular drug accumulation in tumor cells. - Tariquidar (XR9576) is a specific Pgp inhibitor that blocks Pgp function for up to 24 hours after a single dose without significant toxicity in animals and humans. - In adults, tariquidar in combination with doxorubicin, paxlitaxel, or vinorelbine is well tolerated, and only minor alterations in the clearance and drug exposure (area under the concentration time curve, AUC) of the anticancer drugs have been observed. Objectives: - Study the tolerance and toxicity profile of tariquidar at three dose levels in combination with one of three anticancer drugs (doxorubicin, docetaxel, vinorelbine) in pediatric patients with refractory solid tumors including brain tumors. - Define the maximum tolerated dose of tariquidar in children if dose-limiting toxicity is observed at doses less than or equal to 2 mg/kg. - Study the pharmacokinetics of tariquidar alone and in combination with doxorubicin, docetaxel or vinorelbine in pediatric patients. - Study the pharmacodynamics (effect on Pgp function) of tariquidar ex vivo in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (CD56+) with a rhodamine uptake assay and in vivo in tissues and tumor by (99m) Tc-sestamibi scan. - Study alterations in the acute toxicity and pharmacokinetic profile of doxorubicin, vinorelbine or docetaxel when administered in combination with tariquidar. - When possible, assess Pgp expression in tumor specimens by immunohistochemistry and compare immunohistochemisty results with in vivo Pgp functional studies (99m) Tc-sestamibi scan). Eligibility: -Children and adolescents (greater than or equal to 2 years and less than or equal to 18 years of age) with histologically confirmed relapsed or refractory solid tumors that are measureable or evaluable. Design: - Tariquidar will be administered alone and in combination with doxorubicin, vinorelbine, or doctaxel. Tariquidar dose levels will be 1, 1.5, and 2 mg/kg. Intrapatient dose escalation of tariquidar is permitted. - Detailed pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies are performed in cycle 1. - The trial follows a standard phase 1 design with 3 to 6 patients per dose level. At the recommedmed dose of tariquidar, 6 patients will be enrolled with each cytotoxic agent. Up to 36 patients will be entered on this trial. \n",

Research studies suggest that symptoms in individuals with allergies may be aggravated by exposure to particulate air pollution. We sought to experimental determine this by exposing human volunteers to combustion particles, a component of air pollution, and then challenge them with an allergen such as ragweed or oak tree pollen. Using biological tests we can measure whether the allergen response is magnified by prior particulate exposure. \n",

The nasal cavity is both an excellent model of allergic inflammation and provides an easily accessible site for study. We measured inflammatory cells and cytokines in the nasal lavage fluid. Our specific hypothesis was that particulate exposure prior to allergen challenge would enhance inflammatory cell recruitment and expression of inflammatory cytokines. \n",

      " Specific nutrient deficiencies have been described in children with ADHD including zinc, magnesium, calcium, and essential fatty acids. In addition, children with ADHD have been noted to behave and concentrate better in some studies when the ratio of protein compared with carbohydrate in their diets was increased, however, this was anecdotal information noted from studies designed to study other factors, so its not clear if the increased protein is actually the cause of the improved behavior. In our clinical practice, we have noted a high incidence of what appears to be carbohydrate \"craving\" among children with ADHD, which can put children at risk for obesity, diabetes type II, and additional dysregulation of mood and concentration. Carbohydrate craving is a well-documented phenomenon in adults, particularly those with certain patterns of obesity, mood disorders, or those undergoing smoking cessation programs. It has not been studied in children, however. Thus, this initial study was designed to determine 1) whether or not children with ADHD have different patterns of nutrient intake compared with children in the same family and children in families without a child with ADHD, 2) if the described nutrient deficiencies are due to decreased intake, and 3) whether there is an increased occurrence of carbohydrate craving, based on parents' perceptions, eating patterns, and actual intake, among children (or certain subgroups of children) with ADHD. The information gained from this study will be used to design additional studies to test causative hypotheses and intervention strategies. \n",

Little is known about how abacavir is cleared by the body in adolescents. It has been shown that young children require a higher abacavir dose based on weight than adults. Older children, or adolescents, may not require as high a dose. This study may provide information as to whether the children's dose or the adult dose is better for HIV-infected adolescents. \n",

Participants screened under this protocol will not be required to join a research study; the decision will be voluntary. Patients with head and neck cancer may enroll in this study. Participants may undergo various tests, described below, to determine their eligibility for participation in a specific clinical trial. Other tests may also be required, depending on the protocol or treatment for which the patient is being considered: - Blood tests About 3 to 5 tablespoons of blood will be drawn for routine tests, HLA typing and hepatitis and HIV screening. - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) This imaging procedure uses a powerful magnetic field to produce pictures of parts of the body in small section views. The test does not use radiation and may be done with or without a contrast dye material. - Computerized tomography (CT) This procedure uses x-rays to produces three-dimensional images of body organs in small section views. A contrast dye may or may not be used. - Positron emission tomography (PET) PET scans allow the doctor to see the activity of cells in specific body tissues. It requires injection of a radioactive material that attaches to a sugar fluid. The fluid goes to very active cells, such as cancer cells, revealing tumors. - Pulmonary function tests These tests use a machine the patient breathes into to measure the volume of air the patient can move in and out of the lungs. - Arteriogram, or angiogram The anatomy of the blood vessels can be seen using this procedure, which involves placing a small catheter (plastic tube) into an artery and injecting a contrast solution. Special X-rays are then taken to show the blood vessels. - Endoscopy This procedure is done to evaluate the mouth and throat. A tube with a light on the end and special fibers is inserted down the throat to allow the surgeon to examine the throat and, if needed, biopsy a piece of tissue for microscopic study. The test is usually done under general anesthesia in the operating room. - Biopsy A piece of tissue or tumor is removed for examination under the microscope. When a biopsy is done in the neck area, a small amount of anesthetic is injected into the area of the biopsy. The biopsy may be done with 1) a small needle to pull out some tissue, 2) a cookie-cutter-like instrument to punch out a small piece of tissue, or 3) a small knife to cut out a piece of tissue. A knife biopsy may be done in the operating room or the clinic depending on the location of the biopsy and precautions required. When the tests are done, the physician will discuss the results with the patient. Patients eligible for a research study will be offered participation. For those not eligible for a study, other therapies will be discussed and the patient will return to the care of his or her primary physician. In special circumstances, patients may be offered standard non-experimental treatment at NIH. \n",
      " This protocol will provide a means for screening potential candidates for NIDCD Head and Neck Surgery Branch (HNSB), and inter-institute protocols with NCI and NIDCR. No investigational treatments will be administered on this protocol. The Principal Investigator may, however, approve a patient who has been determined to be ineligible for investigational protocols to undergo standard treatment because they present a unique clinical experience for maintaining clinical skills of HNSB physicians and training of clinical fellows. Background: Potential research candidates are referred to the NIDCD HNSB by physicians and by patients themselves. Up to half of all research subjects now admitted to NIH protocols are self-referred. Each patient undergoes thorough telephone screening including a request for the results of outside laboratory tests, scans, x-rays and protocols.

      "Title = Mobilization of Stem Cells With G-CSF for Collection From Patients With Diamond-Blackfan Anemia.\n",
      " This study will provide information needed to develop more effective treatments for patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA). Current treatments include steroids, such as prednisone, and blood transfusions. These treatments have potential long-term risk and side effects, including osteoporosis and impaired growth from steroids or iron overload from transfusions. In addition, as patients reach adulthood, they can develop acute leukemia or bone marrow failure. The only cure for DBA is bone marrow transplant, a procedure that itself carries serious risks and is an option for only about 25 percent of patients. DBA is caused by a mutation (error) in a gene that codes for producing red blood cells from stem cells (blood-forming cells produced by the bone marrow). In 5 to 10 years, gene transfer therapy may prove to be an effective treatment for DBA. Before this treatment can be considered, however, more information is needed about DBA patients and how their stem cells function. This study will examine: 1) whether stem cells of patients with DBA respond to G-CSF the same way those of healthy people do. (G-CSF is a drug that causes stem cells to move from the bone marrow to the blood stream, where they can be collected more easily and in larger numbers by a procedure called leukapheresis, described below. If G-CSF does not work well in DBA patients, other collection strategies will have to be explored); and 2) whether the genetic error in DBA can be corrected by gene transfer into patients' stem cells. Patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia 4 years of age and older who weigh at least 27 pounds and who are dependent on red blood cell transfusions may be eligible for this study. Candidates will have a medical history taken and a physical examination and will be seen by the Clinical Center's Department of Medicine Transfusion for leukapheresis evaluation. They will have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of DBA. For these tests, the hip area is anesthetized and a needle is used to draw bone marrow from the hipbone. If needed, the procedure will be done under sedation. Patients will be given G-CSF by injection under the skin for up to 6 days. Blood and stem cell counts will be measured from a teaspoon of blood drawn each morning. On the morning of the fifth dose, the patient will undergo leukapheresis for collection of stem cells. For this procedure, a large catheter (with a diameter no larger than that of a straw) is placed in an arm vein to allow blood to flow into a cell separator machine. Most children and some adults do not have veins large and strong enough for this tubing, so a large intravenous line called a \"central line\" is placed into a large vein in the neck or groin. This is done under sedation and with a local anesthetic. While the patient lies on a bed or recliner, whole blood is collected through a catheter in one arm or the central line, the stem cells are separated out by spinning, then the red cells, platelets and plasma are returned through a second catheter in the other arm or a second opening in the central line. The procedure takes about 3 to 5 hours, during which the patient can watch television or videos and have family members at the bedside for company. When the procedure is completed, the patient's participation in the protocol ends. Some of the stem cells collected by leukapheresis will be used for research and some will be frozen and stored for possible future transplantation into the patient, if required. \n",
      " Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a congenital hypoproliferative anemia that generally presents in infancy. The mainstays of treatment, prednisone and transfusion therapy, have long-term toxicity in many patients, and bone marrow transplantation with an HLA-matched donor is an option for only a minority of patients. Most importantly, patients with DBA have an increased risk of progression of myelodysplastic syndrome, leukemia, and aplastic anemia compared to the general population. The characterization of potentially mutated genes in DBA is an area of active research, and at least one mutation present in about one-fourth of DBA patients may cause disease due to decreased production of a ribosomal protein. This finding raises the possibility that the disease, at least in some patients, may be correctable by genetic therapy, by which a normal copy of the mutated gene can be introduced into the \"stem cells\" which give rise to red cells. It is therefore of interest to identify any particular characteristics of DBA patients which might delay or hinder the application of gene therapy to their disease. This pilot study of 15 patients is designed to evaluate: 1) the CD34+ cell mobilization response to administration of standard doses of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), 2) the potential for stem cells from DBA patients to be collected by large volume leukapheresis of subjects who have been given G-CSF, and 3) the ability of these G-CSF mobilized cells to be transduced with vectors being developed for gene therapy applications. Outcome parameters to be monitored are the mobilization response to G-CSF, the safety profile and tolerance of G-CSF and leukapheresis, and the efficiency of transduction of DBA stem cells with standard gene therapy vectors. Effectiveness will be gauged by historical comparison of these parameters to normal healthy age-matched volunteer. It is important to point out that there is no therapeutic intent to the majority of this protocol or direct benefit for enrolled patients. We do plan, however, to cryopreserve the remainder of the mobilized cells collected by apheresis for possible autologous transplantation in the event of the patient's progression to leukemia of bone marrow failure in the future. \n",

      " Water supplies in many parts of the world contain naturally occurring arsenic. Previous studies have shown that arsenic at high doses can cause cancer of the bladder. The risk at lower doses is unknown. This study is examining the relationship between ingested arsenic and bladder cancer in central Nevada and Kings County, California, two areas where a large percentage of the population was exposed to drinking water containing arsenic at low to moderate levels. Approximately 200 people with bladder cancer and 400 people without bladder cancer will be included. Subjects are interviewed by telephone about past residences, occupations, diet, drinking water consumption, and other lifestyle factors. Arsenic measurements in well water have been collected from the appropriate state agencies and are being matched with residences and drinking water consumption rates to estimate lifetime arsenic exposures for each subject. People with bladder cancer will then be compared to those without to see if people with cancer were more likely to have lived in areas with arsenic in their drinking water. \n",

The objectives of this study are: (1) to conduct a controlled comparative study of the effectiveness of subatmospheric pressure dressing (SPD) in healing pressure ulcers versus conventional saline wet-to-moist dressing techniques; (2) to establish indications and contra-indications for use of SPD In treating pressure ulcers; and (3) to develop a noninvasive, clinically usable optical digitizer and associated software for measurement of wound geometry for standardized quantitative assessment and longitudinal monitoring of wound healing. \n",
      " Many spinal cord injury (SCI) and otherwise debilitated patients develop pressure ulcers over the course of their injury or disease. Despite enhanced wound care management, many pressure ulcers do not heal completely and require surgical myocutaneous rotational flap coverage. Even then they often recur. HYPOTHESIS: Subatmospheric pressure dressing (SPD) treatment applied to pressure ulcers will either completely close them, or heal to a point allowing for skin graft coverage, more often than 0.9% normal saline wet-to-moist dressing (WTMD) treatment. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study are: (1) to conduct a controlled comparative study of the effectiveness of subatmospheric pressure dressing (SPD) in healing pressure ulcers versus conventional saline wet-to-moist dressing techniques; (2) to establish indications and contra-indications for use of SPD In treating pressure ulcers; and (3) to develop a noninvasive, clinically usable optical digitizer and associated software for measurement of wound geometry for standardized quantitative assessment and longitudinal monitoring of wound healing. RESEARCH METHODS: 120 patients with stage III or IV pressure ulcers meeting the project selection criteria will be recruited for the project. Patients will be randomly assigned in a 3:1 (SPD to WTMD) ratio to either the control group receiving 0.9% normal saline wet-to-moist wound dressing and treatment, or to the subatmospheric pressure dressing group. All subjects selected will be further stratified according to degree of wound severity, nutritional status, and evidence of wound infection. The WTMD group will receive 0.9% NS moistened gauze applied to the wound, which will be changed every 8 hours. The SPD group will receive SPD dressing with the VACTM system set at a constant subatmospheric pressure of negative 125 mmHg. The SPD device and dressing will be left in place and changed every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. The subjects' pressure ulcers will be measured on day 0 and then on a weekly basis. Ulcer surface shape, area, and coloration will be recorded with a digital camera and also by tracing the ulcer perimeter on a flexible translucent plastic film with grid overlaid on the wound. In addition, an optical laser scanner will used to record ulcer shape, area, and coloration, and body/limb segmental volume in the region of the wound. Volume will also be measured using alginate wound impressions to form RTV silicone molds for fluid displacement measurement. The molds of the wounds will also be optically digitized and wound perimeter, topical surface area, total 3-D surface area, and volume calculated using computer image processing, planimetry, and volumetry software developed in the project. Local body/limb segment volume will also be calculated to monitor edematous fluctuations. Based on these measurements, the wound responses will be scored as described in Table 2 after one month or at the time of the patient's withdrawal from the study. The association between response level and treatment type will be analyzed using Chi-square test of association. Mantel-Haenszel Chi-square and logistic regression will be used to control for prognostic variables. \n",

In addition, we will incorporate into the treatment protocol a promising non-invasive technique of partial body weight-supported (BWS) gait training on a treadmill.

      " Stroke is the third leading cause of disability in the United States. To date, conventional rehabilitation is not able to restore normal, safe, gait for many individuals with stroke. We have identified nine gait component deficits which respond to the FNS-IM intervention. This study will test a refined treatment protocol of 3 months duration to restore volitional gait by restoring those nine gait components simultaneously. In addition, we will incorporate into the treatment protocol a promising non-invasive technique of partial body weight-supported (BWS) gait training on a treadmill. BWS and FNS-IM have the potential to provide additive effects for the patient and restore volitional gait more quickly and more completely than would otherwise be possible with one technique alone. Therefore, our first hypothesis is HYPOTHESIS I: BWS combined with FNS-IM, simultaneously applied to nine critical gait components, will restore volitional normal, safe gait to patients with chronic stroke within 3 months. An advantage of BWS gait training is that it is non-invasive. Consequently, we must demonstrate the additive advantage of FNS-IM technique alone. Therefore the second hypothesis is: HYPOTHESIS II: FNS-IM plus BWS will restore volitional gait more quickly and completely for patients with chronic stroke compared with BWS alone. A total of thirty six chronic stroke patients will be randomly divided into two treatment groups (1) FNS-IM plus BWS; (2) BWS alone. Outcome measures for hypothesis testing will be threefold : 1) Gait normality (kinematics of nine gait components); 2) Safety (number of falls); 3) Functionality (gait speed, walking endurance, and CHART, a handicap measure of mobility and activity level). Data will be collected every four weeks during the three months of treatment. Maintenance of gains will be monitored at two additional data collections at six months and one year following the end of the treatment period. Results of this study have the potential to provide the following clinically applicable information: 1. For patients with stroke, a refined treatment protocol of 3 months duration for restoration of normal, safe, volitional gait which is practical within the current healthcare milieu. 2. A definitive recommendation regarding the most effective treatment for chronic stroke patients: (1) BWS plus FNS-IM or (2) BWS alone. RESEARCH OBJECTIVES 1. Build stimulators and electrodes. 2. Obtain measures pre and post intervention for the two groups (FNS-IM + BWS; and BWS alone) to detect gains in: a) gait pattern; b) safety; c) functional capability; and d) quality of life. 3. Analyze data for the group receiving FNS-IM + BWS, in order to test Hypothesis I. 4. Produce therapy protocols for FNS-IM and BWS intervention, and treatment progression. 5. Test Hypothesis II by comparing the two treatment groups (BWS vs BWS + FNS-IM). \n",

Blood sugar control during pregnancy is important to prevent complications for the newborn. The variation and timing of the blood sugar measurements in gestational diabetics and how this relates to the baby's outcome is controversial. We will use an FDA approved device called Minimed Glucose Continuous Monitor, which is used in clinical practice for certain diabetics. It is very small, similar to a beeper, and is connected to the patient through a small plastic catheter subcutaneously. This measures blood sugar every five minutes for a total of 288 readings a day with minimum discomfort. The hypothesis of this study is that use of the Minimed glucose monitor will provide information about variations of blood sugar in gestational diabetics that is missed by capillary glucose monitors. Our conclusions will allow us to compare blood glucose trends among the groups. After the data is analyzed in this pilot study, we plan to design a bigger study involving more subjects to study the impact of the blood sugar variations in the outcome of the newborn, and to obtain generalizable results for the population in general. \n",

      " Sickle cell anemia is an autosomal recessive disorder and the most common genetic disease affecting African-Americans. Approximately 0.15% of African-Americans are homozygous for sickle cell disease, and 8% have sickle cell trait. Acute pain crisis, acute chest syndrome (ACS), and secondary pulmonary hypertension are common complications of sickle cell anemia. Mortality rates of sickle cell patients with pulmonary hypertension are significantly increased as compared to patients without pulmonary hypertension. Recent studies report up to 40% mortality at 22 months after detection of elevated pulmonary artery pressures in sickle cell patients. Furthermore, pulmonary hypertension is thought to occur in up to 30% of clinic patients with sickle cell anemia. This study is designed to determine the prevalence and prognosis of secondary pulmonary hypertension in adult patients with sickle cell anemia, and to determine whether genetic polymorphisms in candidate genes contribute to its development or response to treatment. \n",

      "Title = Stachybotrys Induced Hemorrhage in the Developing Lung.\n",
      " The majority of the workscope of this project is focussed on an infant animal model of toxigenic mold induced pulmonary hemorrhage. Clinically related studies are directed only to the description of human infants diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage regarding their clinical parameters, and collecting samples of secretion, blood, and urine for analysis for fungal spores and mycotoxins. These latter analyses are being developed using the infant rat model. \n",
      " Over the past seven years in the Cleveland, Ohio area there have been 47 cases of unexplained pulmonary hemorrhage in young infants. Sixteen of the infants have died. A CDC case-control study found an association with water-damaged homes and the toxigenic fungus, Stachybotrys chartarum, which requires water soaked cellulose to grow. The spores of this fungus are not infectious in the lung but do contain very potent mycotoxins which appear to be particularly toxic to the rapidly developing lungs of young infants. Secondary stresses, e.g. environmental tobacco smoke, appear to be important triggers of overt hemorrhage. Concern that there may be a larger number of undetected young infants with this disorder led to the examination of all infant coroner cases, which revealed six sudden infant death syndrome cases with major amounts of pulmonary hemosiderin-laden macrophages, indicating extensive hemosiderosis existing prior to death. All of these infants had lived in the eight zip code area where all but fifteen of the patients have lived. This disorder may extend beyond Cleveland since toxigenic fungi are widespread. We are aware of a total of 138 infants with idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage across the country over the past four years. The purpose of this proposal is to establish an infant animal model for this stachybotryomycotoxicosis which can be used to understand the developmental pathophysiology by which the fungal spores induce hemorrhage and to address practical problems faced in the clinical care of these infants and in public health prevention. The model uses tracheal instillation of toxic Stachybotrys spores in neonatal to weanling rats to initiate the pathological process, followed by stresses to trigger acute hemorrhage. Capillary fragility to transmural pressures will be assessed by morphometric analysis of electron micrographs. Markers of Stachybotrys exposure which can be applied to clinical cases are being developed and tested in the rats. \n",

      " Primary Objective: Low back pain is a frequent cause of disability and a common reason for outpatient care in veterans. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lower back often reveals abnormalities, which may be used to justify expensive and invasive therapy, such as surgery. Yet the link between MRI abnormalities and the risk of developing clinically significant back pain is far from clear. This longitudinal study will determine the prevalence and incidence of MRI abnormalities among veterans and determine the extent to which specific MRI abnormalities predict future development of back pain. The results should help clinicians use MR imaging more efficiently, and they may ultimately help reduce the frequency of unnecessary back surgery. Study Abstract: Low back pain is the second most common symptomatic reason for physician visits in the U.S. resulting in over $24 billion annually in direct health care costs. A survey of primary care patients a the Seattle VA revealed that more than one-quarter experienced back pain severe enough to require a visit to a health care practitioner. Imaging plays a vital role in the valuation of patients with back pain. However, a causal relationship between imaging abnormalities and back pain has yet to be clearly established. Abnormalities of the lumbar spine on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging are common and increase with age to the point that they are nearly ubiquitous over the age of 50. Despite this, imaging abnormalities are often used to justify various therapies for low back pain, including expensive and invasive therapy, such as surgery. Prior studies have examined the prevalence of imaging abnormalities, but no study has investigate either the degree of risk that imaging abnormalities impart for the development of low back pain or the incidence of imaging abnormalities. The goal is to examine the natural history of magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine in asymptomatic subjects. We want to determine the relationship of imaging abnormalities to the development of low back pain by comparing patients with normal imaging to those with abnormal imaging \n",

      "Title = Serotonin in Alcoholism.\n",
      " This study uses positron emission tomography (PET) scanning to study how serotonin works in alcoholics. Serotonin is a chemical that allows brain cells to communicate. There is evidence that people with alcoholism have altered serotonin; their brains begin to make and break down serotonin more slowly than people who do not drink. PET scans use radioactive substances injected into the body. A special camera detects the radiation emitted by the radioactive fluid and a computer processes the radioactivity into images of the brain, which show the activity of brain chemicals like serotonin. People with alcohol dependency may participate in this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history, including questions about alcohol and drug use, physical examination, blood tests, breath alcohol tests, electrocardiogram (ECG), urine test for illicit drugs and, for women, a pregnancy test, and a stool test for hidden blood. They also undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain and complete questionnaires on their alcohol and drug history. Participants undergo the following tests and procedures: - Diet low in tryptophan. Tryptophan is an amino acid from which serotonin is made. - Brain MRI before starting the study to make sure brain structure is normal. - Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to collect a small sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A local anesthetic is given and a needle is inserted in the space between the bones (vertebrae) in the lower back. About 2 tablespoons of fluid is collected through the needle. - Arterial catheter (plastic tube) placed in an artery in the wrist area for drawing blood samples. The skin is numbed with a local anesthetic for placement of the catheter. - Intravenous (IV) catheter placed in a vein for injecting the radioactive isotope used in the PET scan. - Two PET scans - baseline and active. - Amino acid drink (orange flavored) before the active PET scan. The drink lowers tryptophan levels. - Amino acid capsules - 23 amino acid capsules are taken with the orange drink. - Genetic analysis to help understand serotonin and alcoholism. A blood sample is collected for DNA testing and possibly establishment of a cell line (collection of cells that are grown in the laboratory from an original tissue specimen) for other genetic studies. Patients are admitted to the intensive care unit for the lumbar puncture and arterial line procedures. After these procedures are complete, the patient is transferred by stretcher to the PET suite for scanning. During the two scans, blood samples are drawn from the artery and a small amount of CSF is collected each hour of the study. Each PET scanning session lasts about 3 hours. The study lasts 36 hours, during which time the subject remains in bed. \n",
      " This research concerns the study of serotonin (5-HT) synthesis, metabolism (turnover), and release. We hypothesize that neuronal 5-HT turnover and release is altered in alcoholic individuals, and that this plays a role in alcohol seeking behavior. We wish to determine the following: 1. Whether there are differences in 5-HT turnover and release in alcoholics compared to healthy research comparison participants, before and after Acute Tryptophan Depletion (ATD); 2. Whether putative differences in 5-HT turnover are governed primarily by genetic variation in the 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) in alcoholics; 3. Whether 5-HTT genetic variation correlates with [(18) F]-FCWAY/5-HT(1A), binding, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) concentration, before and after ATD; and, 4. If regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) differs at baseline and after ATD in alcoholics and healthy research comparison participants. To investigate the underlying biochemistry of 5-HT neurometabolism, we will use two experimental strategies, Acute Tryptophan (TRP) Depletion (ATD) and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, to investigate 5-HT neurochemistry. We will deplete plasma TRP, using ATD, while simultaneously collecting CSF 5-HIAA and performing intermittent plasma sampling via indwelling catheters. TRP is the amino acid (AA) precursor needed for 5-HT synthesis. 5-HIAA is the principal metabolite of 5-HT. It is a neurochemical marker of neuronal 5-HT metabolism. PET will allow indirect measurements of synaptic 5-HT concentration by measuring binding of [(18)F]-FCWAY, a 5-HT (1A)-receptor antagonist. rCBF will be measured with [(15)O]-water imaging. Studies will be performed before and after ATD. Individuals will be genotyped for the 5-HT transporter (5-HTT). Plasma TRP and Large Neutral Amino Acids (LNAAs), and CSF TRP and 5-HIAA concentrations will be measured using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). \n",

      " This study will evaluate whether fluoxetine (Prozac), used together with traditional psychotherapy, can reduce aggression in people who are physically violent towards their spouses or significant others. Treatment for domestic violence has centered on behavioral therapies, such as anger management and self-control exercises. Recent studies have shown that fluoxetine-a drug commonly used to treat depression and panic disorder-can decrease acts of aggression. Men and women between the ages of 18 and 65 who have a history of inflicting physical aggression on a spouses or significant others in the past year (with at least one episode occurring not under the influence of alcohol) may be eligible for this study. Participants spouses or significant others will also be asked to participate. All potential participants will be screened with a medical and psychiatric evaluation and history, breath alcohol analysis, blood tests, urine drug screen and electrocardiogram. Those enrolled will undergo the following procedures: Perpetrator - Interview and questionnaires - Participants will be interviewed by a social worker about past and current mental health and use of alcohol and illicit drugs and will complete questionnaires assessing emotional state and personality, depression, anxiety, aggression and alcohol consumption. Some of the questionnaires will be repeated at monthly intervals. - Physical performance testing - Performance and speed will be measured in three separate training sessions that involve repeatedly pressing a button on a button box console, earning points worth money. - Dyadic interaction paradigm - Participants will interact with their spouse/significant other in a small room, first discussing a neutral topic, such as the day's events, and then a subject that has been a source of conflict. - Fluoxetine administration - Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either 10 mg. of fluoxetine or placebo (identical capsules with no active ingredients) once a day for 3 days, then twice a day, increasing up to four capsules a day if there are no serious side effects. Blood will be drawn once a month to measure drug levels. At the end of 3 months, participants taking placebo may remain in the study and receive fluoxetine. - Clinic visits - Participants are followed in the clinic weekly for the first month, then twice a month for the next 2 months for adjustment of number of pills, evaluation of aggressive behavior and alcohol consumption, and therapy for issues of self-esteem, anger management and communication skills. Couples therapy aimed at conflict resolution and improving communication skills will be offered. - Genetic tests (optional) - Blood will be drawn to determine if there is a relationship between genes involved in a chemical process (serotonin reuptake) that is influenced by fluoxetine and the participant's response to the drug. Spouse/Significant other: Spouses/significant others will complete several questionnaires once a month (total 4 times) to rate their partners' behavior while in the study. They will also participate in the dyadic interaction paradigm described above at the beginning and end of the study. \n",
      " There are no controlled studies assessing the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions to decrease aggression in perpetrators of domestic violence. Since serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) have been shown to decrease aggression in other patient populations, we will examine the effectiveness of SSRIs in reducing aggression in perpetrators of domestic violence. In this protocol, perpetrators of domestic violence will be randomized according to a double-blind design to receive either the SSRI, fluoxetine, or placebo. All participants will receive psychotherapy. All participants will also be carefully monitored in the outpatient clinic on a regular basis for three months. Drug efficacy will be established using validated rating scales and provocative aggression inducing paradigms. \n",

      "Title = PS-341 and Radiation to Treat Advanced Cancer of the Head and Neck.\n",
      " This study will test the safety and effects of the experimental drug PS-341 plus radiation therapy in patients with head and neck cancer. PS-341 can slow or halt the growth of cancer cells grown in culture or in mice. In addition, the drug appears to enhance the effectiveness of radiation treatment. Patients 18 years of age and older with head and neck cancer that cannot be treated adequately with surgery and cannot be cured with standard radiation and chemotherapy may be eligible for this study. Patients whose cancer has spread to the brain may not participate. Before treatment begins participants are evaluated with CT or MRI scans of the head, neck and chest area to determine the extent of the cancer; an electrocardiogram and blood tests; and a neurocardiovascular evaluation that includes measuring blood pressure in different body positions and involves injections of phenylephrine and nitroglycerine. Some patients may undergo a procedure in which a tube is inserted into the larynx (voice box), bronchi (breathing tubes) and esophagus (food tube) and tissue samples removed. This procedure is done under general anesthesia in the operating room. Patients receive radiation treatments Monday through Friday and injections of PS-341 twice a week during the radiation therapy. After 3 weeks of treatment, PS-341 injections are stopped for 2 weeks. Some patients continue to receive radiation treatments during the 2-week break, and others do not, depending upon when they enter the trial. The total duration of radiation treatment varies from 6 to 8 weeks, depending on whether the patient received radiation in the region of the head and neck cancer before entering the study. Patients have a blood sample drawn before and after each new PS-341 injection to measure the drug action in the blood and to see how strong and how long the effects on the blood last. They are seen in the clinic at least once a week for a history and physical examination. A blood sample is collected at each visit to look for toxic effects of PS-341. Near the end of treatment, the neurocardiovascular evaluation is repeated, and if the results are abnormal, it is repeated again 3 months after treatment is completed. X-rays or MRI scans are done 12 weeks after radiation therapy has ended and then every few months after that to determine the extent of disease. Patients whose tumor is accessible are asked to undergo a biopsy (removal of a small piece of tumor tissue) on the first and second day after receiving the first PS-341 dose to examine the effect of the drug on the tumor. The PS-341 dose is increased in successive groups of at least 3 patients until the highest dose that can be given safely with radiation is reached. Patients who develop severe side effects from the drug temporarily stop taking it to allow the side effects to improve. If needed, the dose may be decreased. Radiation therapy may also be stopped temporarily in patients who develop severe effects on the mouth, throat or skin. Side effects may be treated with increased fluid (by mouth, stomach tube, or vein), anti-nausea or anti-diarrhea medications, pain medications and medications to boost red or white cell counts or platelets. The drug Florinef may be given to help regulate body fluids and blood pressure. ... \n",
      " Background: - The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway regulates the degradation of important regulatory proteins and transcription factors that control the cell cycle and cell death. Proteasome inhibition can lead to block of different phases of the cell cycle, and block expression of genes that prevent cell death induced by radiation or other cytotoxic therapeutic agents. - In preclinical studies, proteasome inhibitor PS-341 has demonstrated cytotoxic, radiosensitizing, and anti-tumor activity against squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (SCCHN). Objectives: - The primary objective of this phase I dose escalation clinical study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of PS-341 to be given concomitant with radiation in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. - Secondary objectives include detection of 20S proteasome inhibition, cell cycle block, apoptosis and inhibition of transcription factor NF-kappaB activation in tumor tissue biopsies following PS-341 and radiation. Eligibility: - Persistent or recurrent SCCHN, - Eligible for local primary or re-irradiation, - ECOG performance less than or equal to 2, life expectancy > 3 months, - Adequate organ function (PLT > 100, 000/microL, neutrophils > 1500/mciroL, serum creatinine < 1.5 times the upper limits normal (ULN), serum bilirubin < 1.5 times the ULN, serum transaminases < 2.5 times the ULN) - No systemic chemotherapy within the past 4 weeks and recovered from chemotherapy toxicity, - > 6 months since prior radiation. Design: - Phase I dose escalation, standard 3+3 statistical design, up to 51 subjects, - PS-341 will be given in escalating doses of 0.6, 0.9 and 1.2 mg/m(2) in cohorts of 3 or more patients by IV bolus on M, Th (or T, F), and radiation will be given in 1.8 Gy fractions M-F to 60 Gy in previously radiated or 72Gy in previously unirradiated patients. - Radiation and/or drug will be given in two courses split by a two week rest to allow recovery from combined modality therapy. \n",

      " This study will examine and compare the effects of intense exercise on the release of catecholamines in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and in healthy persons. Catecholamines are hormones (adrenaline and noradrenaline) that are produced by the adrenal glands and released into the blood stream during stress, such as trauma, illness, intense exercise, or low blood sugar. The study will also assess exercise tolerance in patients with CAH, compared with healthy persons. Patients with CAH between the ages of 10 and 40 years who are managing well on standard treatment (glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids) may be eligible for this study. Healthy volunteers that match the enrolled patients in age, sex, race and body fat will be recruited as control subjects. All candidates will be screened with a medical history, physical examination and electrocardiogram (EKG). Body fat will be measured using an instrument called a Bod Pod. The body fat measurement has two parts: first, the subject sits quietly in a large egg-shaped capsule for about 2 to 3 minutes; then the subject breathes into a plastic tube for one minute, followed by three quick panting breaths. Women will have a urine pregnancy test; pregnant women cannot participate in the study. Participants will undergo three exercise sessions on separate consecutive mornings after fasting overnight. Before each test, patients (not healthy volunteers) will take either an additional morning dose of hydrocortisone or a placebo (a lookalike pill with no active ingredient). Before each test a thin catheter (plastic tube) will be placed into an arm vein through a needle. A numbing cream can be applied to make the needle stick hurt less. Blood will be drawn through this intravenous (IV) line before, during and after the exercise tests. The first test is a maximal exercise test to determine the individual's maximum exercise fitness capacity. The second two and third tests are a standardized exercise tests. Before the two standardized tests, patients (not healthy volunteers) will take either an additional morning dose of hydrocortisone or a placebo (a lookalike pill with no active ingredient). All tests are done on a stationary bicycle. Maximal Exercise Test - The subject pedals on a stationary bicycle for about 10 minutes. After a 3-minute warm-up, the workload is increased continuously until either the subject can no longer continue or the physician stops the test for medical reasons. During the exercise, heart rate and heart activity are monitored with an EKG, and the subject wears a nose clip and mouthpiece connected to a breathing tube to measure oxygen use. Blood is drawn before and during the test, totaling no more than 2 tablespoons. Standardized Exercise Test - The subject pedals on a stationary bicycle for 20 minutes, while wearing the nose clip and mouthpiece to measure oxygen use. For the first 5 minutes, the subject pedals at a speed that elicits 50 percent of maximal effort (determined by the maximal exercise test); the next 10 minutes are at 70 percent of maximal effort; and the last 5 minutes are at 90 percent. Blood samples drawn before, during (at 15 and 20 minutes) and after exercise (at 30, 40 and 60 minutes) total less than 1/2 cup. Heart rate and heart activity are monitored during the test with an EKG, and temperature is measured before and at the end of the test. \n",
      " Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) denotes a family of inherited disorders with defects in the cortisol biosynthesis. CAH has been traditionally considered a disease restricted to the adrenal cortex. However, recently observed abnormal adrenomedullary structures in three adrenalectomized patients with classic CAH, as well as low baseline urinary and plasma epinephrine levels in children with CAH suggest that this condition is associated with marked morphological and functional abnormalities of the adrenal medulla. The adrenal medulla synthesizes and secretes catecholamines, mainly epinephrine. Catecholamines influence virtually all tissues. Yet, the clinical implications of epinephrine deficiency in humans are not clear. Short-term intense exercise is a natural, quantifiable stimulus of the adrenal cortex and medulla as well as of the sympathetic nervous system. We would like to employ a standard cycle ergometer exercise protocol to study the adrenomedullary and systemic sympathetic function of patients with CAH. This protocol has been run by the Clinical Center Rehabilitation Medicine Department (RMD) for 10 years. No serious adverse effects have been observed or reported in adults and children with a healthy cardiovascular system. The goal of this protocol is to evaluate adrenomedullary and systemic sympathetic function and exercise tolerance in patients with CAH and in appropriately matched healthy controls using the above standardized cycle ergometer test. Subjects with CAH will exercise with and without doubling their morning dose of hydrocortisone to evaluate whether impairments - if present - can be corrected by a \"stress dose\" of hydrocortisone. We hypothesize that subjects with CAH have a reduced epinephrine reserve and impaired exercise tolerance, which can at least partially, be corrected by an increase in exogenous hydrocortisone. We will also determine whether the systemic sympathetic nervous system compensates for the adrenomedullary deficiency as observed in states of acquired adrenal insufficiency. The results of this study will increase the understanding of the physiologic interactions between adrenal cortex and adrenal medulla. \n",

      "Title = Topiramate in the Treatment of Sciatica.\n",
      " This study will test the effectiveness of topiramate to treat pain caused by lumbar radiculopathy, or sciatica. Sciatica results from damage to the lumbar nerve roots, typically causing back pain and sharp, shooting pain down one or both legs. Although sciatica is common, there are no good treatments for it. Topiramate belongs to a group of medications commonly used to treat pain caused by nerve damage. Patients between 18 and 75 years of age who have had sciatica pain daily for at least 3 months may be eligible for this study. (This is taken from the first paragraph of the Qualification Criteria in the consent form. The inclusion criteria on page 6 of the protocol say \"low back pain of 3 months duration or longer present at least 5 out of 7 days a week\" and signs and symptoms of lumbar radiculopathy. Which is correct?) Participants will provide a medical history, as well as occupational and social information. They will undergo a standard neurological examination, including a test of cognitive (thinking) abilities, muscular function, reflexes and a sensory examination. The latter involves testing with a pin placed on the surface of the skin. Participants will also have routine blood tests and will fill out questionnaires on their daily functioning and psychological well being. Additional procedures may include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and possible referral to a psychiatrist for evaluation of depression or emotional difficulties. This \"cross-over\" study consists of two parts. In one part, patients will receive topiramate and in the other, an active placebo. An active placebo is a drug that does not work for the problem being studied but whose side effects are like those of the test drug. Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) is the active placebo used in this study. Diphenhydramine is an allergy medication with very mild side effects, such as drowsiness. During both parts of the study-topiramate and placebo-patients will keep a daily log in which they rate their pain, record other procedures they undergo, such as injections and manipulations, and record medication side effects. In the first week of the study, patients will remain on their current medications and record pain levels once a day. After the first week, they will begin taking the study drugs-either topiramate in increasing doses ranging from 50 to 400 mg. or diphenhydramine in doses ranging from 6.25 to 50 mg. The drug doses will be increased gradually over 4 weeks to minimize possible side effects. Increases will continue until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Patients will continue on the highest tolerated dose for two weeks and then be tapered off gradually over 12 days. They will remain off drugs completely for a 2-day washout period and then begin the next treatment. Those who took topiramate for the first part will take diphenhydramine for the second part and vice versa. A study nurse will call patients twice a week throughout the study to check for problems and answer questions. A physician will see patients 6 weeks after the start of each treatment. During the last visit, at the end of the study, patients will repeat the questionnaires they filled out at the beginning of the study. Patients and their doctors will be informed of the medications that were effective in each individual's care. \n",
      " Irritation or damage to lumbar nerve roots referred to as lumbar radiculopathy or sciatica is a very common clinical entity with a lifetime prevalence of 1-3% in the adult population. Lumbar radiculopathy typically causes back pain and sharp, shooting pain in the leg(s). Despite its prevalence and disabling characteristics, sciatica has never been selectively studied in drug trials. We propose to study the anti-epileptic drug topiramate, which combines multiple potential analgesic actions including sodium channel blockade, GABA agonist-like effects and AMPA/kainate glutamate receptor blockade. Patients will include men and women of all ethnic backgrounds between the ages of 18 and 75 who have had signs and symptoms of sciatica for 3 months or more. The design is a double-blind, two period cross-over study comparing topiramate to placebo. Patients will be called twice a week to individually titrate doses of topiramate towards a maximum of 800 mg per day and monitor side effects. The primary outcome measures in this study will be the daily pain scores in the low back, in the leg and combined. Patients' quality of life and activities of daily living will be secondary outcome measures as assessed by the SF 36, Oswestry, and Beck questionnaires. Sixty five patients will be enrolled in this study and the duration of the study will be 17 weeks, including one week baseline, four week escalation, two week maintenance and two week wash out for topiramate and placebo respectively. \n",

      "Title = Evaluation and Treatment of Patients With Inherited Eye Diseases.\n",
      " This study offers evaluation and treatment for patients with inherited (genetic) eye diseases. The protocol is not designed to test new treatments; rather, patients will receive current standard of care treatments. The purpose of the study is twofold: 1) to allow National Eye (NEI) Institute physicians to increase their knowledge of various genetic eye diseases, identify possible new avenues of research in this area, and maintain their clinical skills; and 2) to establish a pool of patients who may be eligible for new studies as they are developed. (Participants in this protocol will not be required to join a new study; the decision will be voluntary.) Children and adults with genetic eye diseases may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical and family history, thorough eye examination and blood test. The eye examination includes measurements of eye pressure and visual acuity (ability to see the vision chart) and dilation of the pupils with eye drops to examine the lens and retina (back part of the eye). Patients may also undergo additional diagnostic tests needed to determine eligibility for other NEI studies, including routine laboratory testing, imaging, questionnaires, a physical examination, and other standard and specialized tests and procedures as needed. In addition, patients will have special photographs taken of the eye to document the clarity or opacity of the eye lens. They will also undergo a procedure called electroretinography to assess the eye's response to bright lights. For this procedure, the eye is numbed with anesthetic drops and a contact lens is placed in the eye. The patient looks inside a large, hollow sphere and sees flashes of light, first in darkness and then in light. The contact lenses sense small electrical signals generated by the retina. Patients who need medical care will be given appropriate standard medical treatment. Those who are found eligible for a research study will be recommended for participation in that study and taken off this one. Participants will be followed at least 3 years. Follow-up visits are scheduled according to the standard of care for the individual patient's eye problem. Patients in this protocol will probably have 1 to 3 follow-up visits per year. \n",
      " This \"Evaluation and Treatment Protocol\" will allow the geneticists and ophthalmic genetic specialists at the NEI to identify, follow and provide \"standard of care\" treatment to patients with genetic eye disease. The primary purpose of the protocol is to accumulate a cohort of patients with genetic eye disease for possible participation in NEI studies. A secondary purpose is to provide long-term follow-up and treatment for a variety of genetic eye diseases so that the genetic specialists at NEI will be better able to identify research hypotheses about these diseases in addition to maintaining their clinical skills. The availability of cohorts of patients with a spectrum of genetic disorders will be valuable for the training of fellows in ophthalmic genetics, an important mission of the NEI. Finally, the ability to provide long-term follow-up and care will also facilitate referral efforts for new NEI protocols. The genetic specialists at the National Eye Institute will be free to choose those genetic conditions that interest them. However, the total number of patients that can be enrolled in the protocol will be restricted. This protocol is not designed to test any new treatments. Any evaluations or treatment under this protocol will be based on the current standard of care for each genetic condition. Participants in this patient evaluation and treatment protocol will be evaluated for potential eligibility in any new NEI clinical studies as they are developed. If eligible, patients may be asked to participate in the new protocol. However, they will not be required to enter any protocol and their decision to participate will be entirely voluntary. No more than 150 patients will be accepted in this \"Evaluation and Treatment Protocol.\" \n",

      "Title = Stem Cell Mobilization Potential in Patients With Aplastic Anemia in Remission.\n",
      " This study will examine 1) whether it is possible to collect enough stem cells (cells produced by the bone marrow that mature into white and red blood cells and platelets) from patients with aplastic anemia to use for future treatment, and 2) whether patients who have been treated successfully and relapse will benefit from autologous stem cell transfusion (transfusion of their own stem cells). Patients 12 years of age or older with aplastic anemia who have been successfully treated with immunosuppressive drugs and are now in remission may be eligible for this study. Participants will undergo a complete history and physical examination, bone marrow biopsy (removal of a small sample of bone marrow from the hip bone) and blood tests, plus procedures to collect stem cells, as follows: - G-CSF (Filgrastim) administration - G-CSF will be given by injection under the skin daily for up to 10 days. This drug causes stem cells to move from the marrow into the blood where they can be collected more easily. - Apheresis - Stem cells will be collected through apheresis, usually starting the 5th to 6th day of Filgrastim injections. For this procedure, whole blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein. The blood circulates through a cell separator machine where the white cells and stem cells are removed. The red cells, platelets and plasma are returned to the body through a second needle in the other arm. The procedure takes about 5 hours. Up to five procedures, done on consecutive days, may be required to collect enough cells for transplantation. If enough cells are collected, they will be purified (treated to remove the white blood cells) using an experimental device. Removing the lymphocytes may reduce the chance of relapse of aplastic anemia following the stem cell transplant. The stem cells will be frozen for later use, if needed. - Follow-up - Participants are followed at NIH at 6-month intervals. \n",
      " Immune mechanisms are responsible for hematopoietic failure in most cases of acquired aplastic anemia (AA), a disease characterized by hypocellular bone marrow and pancytopenia. In aplastic anemia, much experimental data points toward an immune-mediated pathophysiology of destruction of hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells. Clinically, immunosuppressive therapies, usually anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclosporine (CsA), have been shown to be effective in a large proportion of patients with severe AA. However, at 2 years after initial treatment as many as 35% of patients with initially good response and normal blood counts relapse and require repeated cycles of intense immunosuppression and/or chronic immunosuppressive regimens. Although relapse in previously immunosuppression-responsive patients has a generally good prognosis, there is an increased risk of complications and treatment-related toxicities. The outlook of patients who fail to respond to repeated intensive immunosuppression is poor. While it is likely that some of the treatment failures occurring with conventional immunosuppressive regimens (both at presentation and in relapsed patients) may be due to inability to suppress the autoimmune process leading to the bone marrow failure, more intense therapies such as cyclophosphamide have a high complication rate due to prolonged and dose-related myelosuppression. In this protocol, we propose that patients with severe AA who show a good response to the initial round of immunosuppression undergo stem cell mobilization, collection, and cryopreservation. This pilot study of 20 patients is designed to evaluate: 1) the CD34+ cell mobilization response to administration of standard doses of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and 2) the potential for collecting stem cells from patients with a history of severe AA who have been given G-CSF. Outcome parameters to be monitored are the mobilization response to G-CSF, and the safety profile and tolerance of G-CSF and leukapheresis. Effectiveness will be gauged by historical comparison of these parameters to normal healthy age-matched volunteers. It is important to point out that there is no therapeutic intent to the majority of this protocol or direct benefit for enrolled patients. We do plan, however, to cryopreserve the remainder of the mobilized cells collected by apheresis for possible autologous transplantation in the event of the patient's progression to leukemia or bone marrow failure in the future. \n",

      " This study will try to learn more about the genetic cause and symptoms of microphthalmia (small eyes) or anophthalmia (absence of one or both eyes). Patients with microphthalmia or anophthalmia with mental retardation may be eligible for this study. Patients' parents and siblings will also be included for genetic studies. Patients may participate in both the clinical and laboratory parts of the study or just the laboratory part, as described below: Laboratory The laboratory study consists of DNA analysis to determine the genetic cause of microphthalmia/anophthalmia. The DNA sample is obtained using one of the following methods: - Blood draw - for young children, a numbing cream is applied to the skin before the needlestick to decrease the pain - Skin biopsy - a small piece of skin (about 1/8-inch in diameter) is removed surgically after the area has been numbed with an anesthetic - Cotton swab - a specimen is collected from inside the cheek using a cotton swab. This is done only for patients who cannot provide a blood or skin sample. - Prenatal sample - If, in the case of newborns, specimens are left from prenatal testing, these can be used instead of a blood sample. Some patients may have a permanent cell line grown from the blood or skin sample for use in future research tests. Clinical For the clinical study, participants undergo some or all of the following procedures at the NIH Clinical Center: - Physical examination - Clinical photographs, X-rays, blood tests - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain - a diagnostic procedure that uses a magnetic field and radio waves instead of X-rays to produce images of the brain \n",

This is a heterogeneous group that includes syndromic microphthalmia 1 (MCOPS1) OMIM #309800, and syndromic microphthalmia 2 (MCOPS2) OMIM #300166 and other, as yet to be defined, malformations of the globe. We have identified a causative gene for MCOPS1 (Ng, et al 2004). To further delineate these conditions, we will study families with these features through a combined clinical and molecular approach. Specimens will be collected and evaluated in the laboratory by linkage analysis, physical mapping, candidate gene characterization, mutation screening, genotype-phenotype correlation, and cell biologic studies of normal and mutant proteins. \n",

      " This study will examine the safety of a new genetically engineered antibody called hLL2 (epratuzumab) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It will also evaluate whether hLL2 can lessen overall disease activity in SLE or kidney damage in patients with lupus nephritis. Patients 18 years of age and older with mild to moderately active SLE may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with blood and urine tests, a chest X-ray, electrocardiogram (EKG), tuberculin skin test, and screening tests for certain cancers. All participants will receive weekly infusions of hLL2 for 4 weeks. The drug is given through a catheter (small plastic tube) placed through a needle in an arm vein. Each infusion takes about 2 hours, after which the patient is observed in the clinic for 1 to 2 hours before being discharged from the clinic. The first 3 patients in the study will receive the lowest of three different doses used in the study. If this dose is well tolerated, the next 5 patients will receive a higher dose. If the second dose is tolerated, the last 5 patients will be given the highest dose. If any serious problems are encountered at a dose, patients in the next group will receive either the same or lower dose before being advanced to the next level. Patients in the first group will continue taking prednisone at their regular dose. All other patients will have their prednisone tapered gradually, if their condition permits. Patients who have a disease flare may have their prednisone increased for up to 2 weeks, followed by a gradual taper. If the flare is severe or does not respond to the increased prednisone, the patient will be taken off the study and treated to control the disease. Patients will be evaluated at various intervals for up to 8 weeks after the last dose. Several of the screening tests will be repeated throughout the study. No more than 500 ml of blood-the equivalent of a single blood donation-will be collected during a 2-month period. Participants may also be asked to undergo the following optional procedures before starting treatment, 1 week after the last dose and 8 weeks after the last treatment dose: - Bone marrow aspiration - to collect cells from the bone marrow. The hip area is anesthetized and a special needle is used to draw bone marrow from the hipbone. - Tonsil biopsy - The area to be biopsied is numbed with a local anesthetic and small pieces of tissue will be removed with a special type of forceps. (The procedure may be done under general anesthetic.) - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen - The patient lies on a table within a metal cylinder (the MRI scanner) for about 30 to 40 minutes while images are obtained with the use of a strong magnetic field and radio waves. \n",
      " This is a pilot study to evaluate the safety and tolerance of hLL2 (epratuzumab), a humanized anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody, in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). B-lymphocytes play a major role in initiating and maintaining the underlying immunopathological mechanisms of SLE. In addition to producing autoantibodies, they also serve as antigen presenting cells and are able to disrupt peripheral T lymphocyte tolerance. Furthermore, B lymphocyte depletion ameliorates disease activity in animal models of SLE. Therefore, targeted depletion of B-lymphocytes may be of therapeutic benefit in human SLE. hLL2 (epratuzumab) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to CD22, a surface antigen expressed exclusively on B-lymphocytes. Clinical studies in patients with B cell lymphomas have shown that epratuzumab is safe and well tolerated across a wide range of doses. Although the exact mechanism is unknown, indirect evidence suggests that the antibody is depleting target B lymphocytes. Epratuzumab is made available by Immunomedics, Inc., and will be used under an investigator (NIH)-initiated IND. In this open-label, Phase I study, up to 20 patients with moderately active SLE may be enrolled. Patients will be treated with weekly infusions of hLL2 in one of three different dosing groups [(240 mg/m(2), 360 mg/m(2), 480 mg/m(2)] for 4 weeks, and followed for 8 weeks after the last dose. The primary objective is to determine the safety and tolerability of hLL2 in patients with SLE. In addition to safety data, clinical and laboratory data will also be collected for preliminary evaluation of the effectiveness of hLL2 in SLE and to assess the effect of hLL2 on B and T lymphocytes in the lymphoid organs and the peripheral blood. If the treatment is safe and there is preliminary evidence of efficacy, this regimen could be used in controlled trials in the future. \n",

Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of bryostatin 1 combined with sargramostim in treating patients who have refractory myeloid cancer \n",
      " PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose of continuous intravenous infusion bryostatin-1 when given in combination with GM-CSF. II. To describe and quantify the frequency of toxicity of the combination of continuous intravenous infusion bryostatin-1 and subcutaneously administered GM-CSF. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To describe the impact of the combination of bryostatin-1 and GM-CSF on the differentiation and cell cycle distribution of myeloid cells in vivo. II. To describe the impact of the combination of bryostatin-1 and GM-CSF on T lymphocyte populations. III. To assess the pharmacokinetics of continuous infusion bryostatin-1. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of bryostatin 1. Patients receive bryostatin 1 IV continuously and sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with disease stabilization or improvement may continue treatment for up to 12 courses. Cohorts of 2 patients receive escalating doses of bryostatin 1 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 30% of patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 45 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18 months. \n",

      " RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. It is not yet known if irinotecan is more effective with or without oxaliplatin in treating metastatic colorectal cancer. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of irinotecan with or without oxaliplatin in treating patients who have metastatic colorectal cancer. \n",
      " OBJECTIVES: - Compare the overall survival of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with irinotecan with or without oxaliplatin. - Compare the response rate, time to tumor-related worsening of symptoms, time to disease progression, onset and duration of responses, and duration of disease stabilization in these patients treated with these regimens. - Compare the safety of these regimens in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to Karnofsky performance status (50-60% vs 70-100%), number of metastatic organs involved (1 vs 2 or more), lactic dehydrogenase (no greater than 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) vs greater than 1.5 times ULN), and prior fluorouracil chemotherapy (adjuvant vs first-line treatment for metastatic disease). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. - Arm I: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on day 1. - Arm II: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 120 minutes followed by irinotecan IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat in each arm every 3 weeks for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 30 days, every 4 weeks for 3 months, and then every 3 months thereafter.

      " Hemodialysis remains associated with a high mortality (approximately 22% per year) and many complications despite improvements over the last twenty years. Several nephrologists have suggested that increasing the frequency and amount of dialysis will result in improved outcomes. In fact, various forms of daily dialysis have been performed in over 300 patients in the last 30 years with improvements in blood pressure, quality-of-life, bone disease, and other complications of renal failure. Whether this form of treatment can be expanded to the 220,000 Americans on hemodialysis is unknown. The primary outcome of this study is to determine the effectiveness of nocturnal dialysis in hemodialysis patients in St. Louis. If the pilot study is effective, then participation in a larger, multicenter trial is expected. The endpoints measured are use of antihypertensive medications, improvement in secondary hyperparathyroidism and use of phosphorus binders, quality-of-life measured by SF-36 surveys, and improvement in physical function as measured by maximal oxygen uptake. \n",

      " This study will test the safety and effectiveness of a protein called E-selectin, given as a nasal spray, in preventing the formation of blood clots that can cause stroke. In animal studies, animals that received E-selectin in the nose on a regular schedule had almost no strokes compared with those that did not receive it. Patients over age 45 who have had a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within 1 to 4 months of this study may be eligible to participate. Candidates will be screened with a review of their past medical records and neurologic and medical evaluations that may include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, ultrasound or magnetic resonance angiography (a type of MRI) of the carotid arteries (arteries in the neck that supply blood to the brain), echocardiography (ultrasound test of the heart), electrocardiography (EKG) and blood tests. Participants will have a blood and urine test and will be assigned to one of four treatment groups. Patients in each group will spray a small amount of fluid into their nose according to the following schedule: 5 doses once every other day for 10-days, followed in 3 weeks by another 5 doses every other day for 10-days, followed in 3 weeks by a final series of 5 doses every other day for 10 days. The spray for patients in each group contains the following: - Group 1 - fluid with low dose of E-selectin - Group 2 - fluid with medium dose of E-selectin - Group 3 - fluid with high dose of E-selectin - Group 4 - fluid with no E-selectin Patients will be seen for follow-up visits at 1 month and 3 months after starting E-selectin therapy. The visits will include a neurologic examination and blood and urine tests. Patients will be contacted by phone, fax or e-mail in between the 1- and 3-month visits. \n",
      " In the United States, stroke is the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of disability. Despite the success of recent clinical trials of antithrombotic drugs for the secondary prevention of stroke, annually about 10% of patients with recent cerebrovascular accidents have recurrent strokes. The development of new treatment strategies for the secondary prevention of stroke is an important issue for modern medicine. There is increasing evidence that inflammation at the sites of endothelial activation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of stroke. Control of molecular inflammation at the sites of endothelial activation can be achieved by induction of mucosal tolerance. The induction of mucosal tolerance with repeated, low-dose, intranasal administration of antigen causes a shift of immune response from proinflammatory T(H)1 type to anti-inflammatory T(H)2 type at the sites of inflammation. E-selectin is an adhesion molecule expressed only on activated endothelium in response to proinflammatory cytokines. The major goal of proposed study is to test whether repeated administration of low-dose, intranasal E-selectin can induce mucosal tolerance to this compound causing a shift of immune response from T(H)1 to T(H)2 type in patients with recent stroke or TIA, and secondly to evaluate the safety and tolerability of this strategy for the secondary prevention of stroke. \n",

      " Our data indicate that environmental exposure to the heavy metal lead are more widespread than currently appreciated and that such exposures are associated with the production of human male subfertility. Lead's effects are observed in male partners of infertile couples attending an IVF clinical, in men acting as semen donors in an artificial insemination program and in men representative of the general public. Our goal is to identify the mechanism(s) underlying lead's anti-fertility action. \n",
      " Our goal is to understand how environmental and occupational exposures to heavy and transition metal ions injure the human male reproductive tract. The American Urological Association and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine report that ~15% of couples (i.e., more than 6.1 million people in the U.S.) experience infertility at some time. The male is responsible for infertility of 20% of these couples and contributes to the infertility of another 30-40%. However, the cause(s) of male infertility in many cases is unknown. Our data suggest that lead exposures (in the air, in food and in drinking water) underlie a significant fraction of \"unexplained\" male infertility. We found that blood and seminal plasma lead levels were elevated in 22% of normospermic males from couples seeking infertility treatment, in 29% of semen donors participating in an artificial insemination program and in 23% of unselected semen donors answering an advertisement for research participation. These elevated lead levels were associated with decreased sperm fertility potential in IVF, in artificial insemination and in pregnancy by coitus. The negative effects of lead on sperm function was correlated with expression of specific forms of sperm ion channels (metal binding proteins that allow lead to enter cells), suggesting that such proteins serve as markers for susceptibility or resistance to the reproductive toxic effects of lead. Further, in cases in which human male lead levels changed markedly over time, there were corresponding changes in sperm ion channel, sperm function and sperm fertility potential. These changes were linked to changes in calcium modulated processes in human testis biopsies obtained from infertility patients and could be mimicked in testes of rats experimentally fed lead. In the current study, we plan to identify changes in gene expression important to the production of the infertile state by comparing the genes expressed in the testis of control and lead exposed rats which are resistant or susceptible to lead. These findings will help to explain how lead exposure kill cells within the testis. We will then determine whether the same changes occur in human testis biopsies and ejaculated sperm from infertile males with high body burdens of lead. The expected outcome of this study is the identification of a possible mechanism explaining male infertility associated with low sperm counts or idiopathic male infertility, tools for diagnosis of male infertility and the hope for rationale treatment. \n",

Because medicines for arthritis often help patients with eye inflammation, this study will examine whether TNFR:Fc can help patients with uveitis. Patients with uveitis who are not responding well to standard treatment, such as steroids, and patients who have side effects from other medicines used to treat their uveitis or have refused treatment because of possible side effects may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, and eye examination.

Candidates will also undergo fluorescein angiography-a procedure in which photographs are taken of the retina to see if there is any leakage in the eye's blood vessels. A blood test and joint evaluation will also be done. Study participants will be given an injection of TNFR:Fc twice a week for up to 12 months and may continue other medicines they may be taking, such as prednisone or methotrexate.

The purpose of this study is to find a combination of RTV and IDV that is safe, well tolerated, and produces drug levels in the blood of children that are comparable to effective drug levels in the blood of adults. The effectiveness of the drug combination in decreasing the amount of virus in the body will also be studied. The children enrolled in this study will have high HIV viral loads despite taking anti-HIV drugs. \n",
      " Combination regimens of RTV and IDV in adults offer the benefit of two potent antiretroviral agents, convenience of twice-daily dosing, unrestricted timing of meals, and fewer renal complications. There are limited, largely anecdotal data from children suggesting that initial virologic response can also be attained in children given IDV with RTV, but there are not sufficient pharmacokinetic data to define appropriate dose regimens. This study will evaluate the clinical feasibility of a combination RTV and IDV regimen for children. Patients will be stratified on the basis of age/Tanner stage and ability to swallow intact capsules. Patients will be randomized to either Balanced Dose or Low Dose RTV treatment arms. Patients in the Balanced Dose Arm will receive RTV and IDV in approximately equal doses. The Low Dose RTV Arm will receive a dosing ratio of RTV:IDV of approximately 1:3.

      " This study will determine the best ways to collect, process and store umbilical cord blood from babies with sickle cell disease, sickle cell trait and unaffected babies. Sickle cell disease is an abnormality of the hemoglobin in red blood cells that causes the cells to change shape and clump together, preventing their normal flow in the bloodstream. This impairs blood flow to various organs, and the resulting oxygen deprivation causes organ damage. Cord blood is rich in stem cells (cells produced in the bone marrow that mature to different types of blood cells), which may prove useful in new sickle cell therapies. However, cord blood from babies with sickle cell trait, sickle cell disease and normal babies may act differently under laboratory conditions, so it is important to learn how best to work with blood from all three groups of babies for future use in possible treatments. Pregnant women between 18 and 45 years of age who are at risk of having an infant with sickle cell disease and normal volunteers who are pregnant and not at risk for this disease may be eligible for this study. Potential participants will be counseled about donating her infant s blood in order to make an informed choice. All women who participate in the study will provide a medical history and have blood collected from the umbilical cord and placenta (afterbirth) after the baby s delivery. The blood will be tested for various infectious diseases, processed, frozen and stored for research purposes. In addition, blood from women with babies at risk for sickle cell disease will be tested for the presence of the sickle cell gene, tissue typed, and used for research as follows: - Sickle cell disease If cord blood tests show the baby has sickle cell disease, the blood will be frozen for an indefinite period of time for possible use in future treatment of the child. This treatment could include stem cell transplantation or gene therapy, treatments are not currently considered routine for sickle cell disease. - Sickle cell trait or normal hemoglobin If cord blood tests show the baby has sickle cell trait or is unaffected, the blood will be processed and stored for up to 3 years, during which time it may possibly be used to treat a currently living or future sibling with sickle cell disease. After 3 years, the participant may agree to either have the blood discarded, given to research or moved to another facility for continued storage at the participant s expense, if there is a storage fee. Alternatively, if there is no anticipated future need for the collected blood, or if it does not meet standards needed for future treatment, it will be used in NIH-approved research studies. Participants and their family doctor or the baby s pediatrician will be contacted twice a year for information about changes in the baby s health. Participants may also be asked permission to perform new tests developed by researchers. \n",

      " A long-term study of current treatments for bipolar disorder, including medications and psychosocial therapies. \n",
      " STEP-BD is evaluating all the best-practice treatment options used for bipolar disorder: mood-stabilizing medications, antidepressants, atypical antipsychotics, and psychosocial interventions - or \"talk\" therapies - including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Family-focused Therapy, Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy, and Collaborative Care (psychoeducation). There are two kinds of treatment \"pathways\" in STEP-BD, and participants may have the opportunity to take part in both. The medications and psychosocial interventions provided in these pathways are considered among the best choices of treatment for bipolar disorder in everyday clinical practice. In the \"Best Practice Pathway,\" participants are followed by a STEP-BD certified doctor and all treatment choices are individualized. Everyone enrolled in STEP-BD may participate in this pathway. Participants and their doctors work together to decide on the best treatment plans and to change these plans if needed. Also, anyone who wishes to stay on his or her current treatment upon entering STEP-BD may do so in this pathway. Adolescents and adults age 15 years and older may participate in the Best Practice Pathway. For adults age 18 and older, another way to participate is in the STEP-BD \"Randomized Care Pathways.\" Depending on their symptoms, participants may be offered treatment in one or more of these pathways during the course of the study. The participants remain on mood-stabilizing medication. However, because doctors are uncertain which of several treatment strategies work best for bipolar disorder, another medication and/or talk therapy may be added. Each Randomized Care Pathway involves a different set of these additional treatments. Unlike in the Best Practice Pathway, the participants in the Randomized Care Pathways are randomly assigned to treatments. Also, in some cases, neither the participant nor the doctor will be told which of the different medications is being added. This is called a \"double-blind\" study and is done so that the medication effects can be evaluated objectively, without any unintended bias that may come from knowing what has been assigned. Participants will not be assigned medications that they have had bad reactions to in the past, that they are strongly opposed to, or that the doctor feels are unsuitable for them. The medication(s) participants may be randomly assigned to in the Randomized Care Pathways are free of charge. There are other treatment options for participants if they do not respond well to the treatment assigned to them. Also, participants may return to the Best Practice Pathway at any time. About 1,500 individuals will be enrolled in at least one Randomized Care Pathway during their period of participation in STEP-BD. It is important to note that STEP-BD provides continuity of care. For example, if a participant starts out in the Best Practice Pathway and later chooses to enter one of the Randomized Care Pathways, he or she continues with the same STEP-BD doctor and treatment team. Then, after completing the Randomized Care Pathway, the participant may return to the Best Practice Pathway for ongoing, individually-tailored treatment. \n",

Specifically, the study will examine the benefits of the stimulant medication both alone and in combination with fluvoxamine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that has antianxiety effects. Young people aged 6 to 17 diagnosed with these co-occurring disorders may be eligible to participate. \n",
      " Many children and adolescents with mental disorders in the United States are treated with multiple psychotropic medications even though there is not much information on how well these medications work together or if they are safe to administer together. Many youth with ADHD have co-occurring (comorbid) disorders such as oppositional-defiant disorder, anxiety disorders, and mood disorders. There is much interest in the treatment of children and adolescents with comorbid ADHD and anxiety disorders because this is a common condition in clinical practice. When children with both anxiety and ADHD receive stimulant medication for ADHD, their anxiety may not improve. SSRI medications represent a reasonable addition to stimulant treatment, as they are considered effective for anxiety disorders based on controlled trials in adults and open trials in children. However, there are no data from controlled studies regarding the tolerability and dosing of the combination of stimulant treatment (including methylphenidate) and SSRIs in the treatment of children with comorbid ADHD and anxiety disorder. In this study, children and adolescents will be evaluated for the presence of both ADHD and Anxiety Disorder. Approximately 120 children and adolescents with both disorders who meet all the study entry requirements (such as being otherwise medically healthy) will be enrolled. Children and adolescents who are not on a stable dose of a stimulant will first be treated openly with methylphenidate for 6 weeks. Those whose ADHD does not improve during this initial treatment period will not continue in the study but will be referred for further support in the community. Those who show improvement in both their ADHD and anxiety symptoms will stay on methylphenidate for an additional 8 weeks. Those who show improvement in ADHD but not anxiety will be asked to enter the double-blind phase of the study. In this phase, participants will be randomized (assigned by chance) to receive either fluvoxamine or placebo, in combination with stimulant/methylphenidate, for 8 weeks. Children or adolescents who enter the study on a stable dose of stimulant will move directly to the Double-Blind phase. Participants who are assigned to placebo and who do not show an improvement in anxiety after 8 weeks will be eligible for an additional 8 weeks of open treatment with the methylphenidate/stimulant and fluvoxamine combination. At the end of the trial, clinical care will be provided for up to an additional month until referral to an outside clinician can be arranged. \n",

Objectives: The primary objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the clinical accuracy of a telemedicine system for assessing the status of pressure ulcers, both chronic and those which have been surgically repaired. The principal hypotheses were: (1) use of the telemedicine system results in the same diagnoses as does in-person patient assessment; and (2) patients are satisfied with the telemedicine system. Methods: Two VA medical centers and two specialties participated in the study: Ann Arbor (plastic surgery) and Augusta (plastic surgery, physical medicine and rehabilitation). They contributed inpatients and outpatients with a pressure ulcer of stage II, III, or IV over a one-year enrollment period. All study patients were assessed both in-person (the \"gold standard\") and with the telemedicine system. The in-person and telemedicine physicians provided yes/no responses to four diagnostic questions concerning wound healing and infection, based on AHCPR guidelines, and they were blinded to each other�s assessments. Patient satisfaction data were collected using a specially designed, self-administered questionnaire to measure perceptions regarding the burden of the telemedicine system, confidence in the evaluation, and absence of direct contact with a physician.

If it can be demonstrated that treatment via telepsychiatry is as effective as in-person treatment, then many individuals with psychiatric illness will have easy access to psychiatric care, even if they live in geographically remote areas. Objectives: The major goal of this study was to determine whether treatment of depressive disorders via telepsychiatry is as effective as in-person treatment. In addition, this study was designed to determine if depressed patients are as compliant and as satisfied with telepsychiatry as with in-person treatment. Another goal was to compare the cost and cost-effectiveness of remote treatment via telepsychiatry to in-person treatment. Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, veterans who presented with depression to any of three VA Maryland Health Care facilities with a SCID-IV depression diagnosis and a Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (Ham-D) score of 16 or above were eligible for participation. Eligible veterans were randomized to either \"in-person\" treatment or \"remote\" treatment.

      " Background: CBOCs represent one of VA's main managed care strategies for shifting the focus of care from the inpatient to the outpatient setting and for improving the health of our nation's veterans. Hypothesis-driven research is critically needed to test the basic assumptions motivating the expansion of CBOCs throughout the VA health care system. Objectives: The purpose was to determine how increased geographic access to primary care services affects service use and costs. Two specific aims addressed were: 1) to determine how CBOCs impact the service use of all existing users and existing users with the following ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSC): alcohol dependence, angina, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), depression, diabetes and hypertension; and 2) to describe how CBOCs affect the workload and costs of the VA health care system from the VISN's perspective. Methods: A quasi-experimental pre-post study design with intervention and reference groups was employed to compare service use and costs in the 18 months following the establishment of a new CBOC. Fifteen CBOCs from 11 VISNs were included in the analysis. For specific aim 1, the intervention group was defined as existing users in the catchment area of a new CBOC and the reference group was defined as matched existing users outside CBOC catchment areas. Multivariate statistical regression analyses were used to estimate the impact of residing within the CBOC catchment area on use and cost in the post-period, controlling for patient casemix and use/cost in the 18 month pre-period. For specific aim 2, the intervention group was defined as zip codes in the catchment area of a new CBOC and the reference group was defined as matched zip codes outside CBOC catchment areas. Average use and costs for all users, existing users and new users from intervention zip codes and reference zip codes were compared. Status: Complete. \n",

      " Background: Hypertension is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke. Evidence-based guidelines support the use of specific drugs for patients with specific comorbidities to maximize the decrease in cardiovascular risk; yet, many physicians do not follow these guidelines in choosing drug therapy. Objectives: The goal of this project was to evaluate methods of implementing clinical practice guidelines, using hypertension as a model. We hypothesized that providing patient-specific recommendations to clinicians at the time of clinic contact with hypertensive patients would substantially improve guideline concordance of drug therapy without adversely affecting (possibly improving) blood pressure control. Our long-term goal is to develop and evaluate methods of implementing clinical practice guidelines that build on current knowledge about the most effective approaches to changing clinician behavior, and to extend those methods to other cardiovascular diseases. Methods: This project, known as ATHENA, included two major components: (1) We conducted a randomized controlled trial of patient-specific recommendations about drug therapy for hypertension, delivered to primary care clinicians at the time of primary care clinic visits. The recommendations were based on VA Hypertension Guidelines. The trial included 36 clinicians and 4500 hypertensive patients enrolled in primary care clinics at VA Palo Alto Health Care System. We compared a general intervention to an individualized intervention. Both the general and the intervention groups of clinicians received extensive guideline education, as part of a VISN-mandated hypertension guideline implementation. Clinicians randomized to the individualized intervention received, in addition, computer-generated patient-specific recommendations about drug therapy of hypertension, delivered to the clinics with the encounter forms for each visit. (2) In the 2nd major component of the study, we collaborated with Stanford Medical Informatics to develop a hypertension decision support system (ATHENA DSS). ATHENA DSS combines detailed patient information from the VA electronic medical record (VistA) with hypertension guideline knowledge based on the VA and JNC 6 hypertension guidelines. A special feature of ATHENA DSS is that the knowledge in the system can be easily browsed and updated by clinician-managers, so that knowledge can be kept up to date with emerging clinical trial findings about best treatments. We developed an infrastructure to implement the system in a pop-up window in the CPRS-GUI in the primary care clinics at VA Palo Alto. We also conducted an offline test of the program logic by comparing the ATHENA DSS recommendations with those made by a physician for 100 randomly selected VA patients. Status: In the past year, we have completed the data collection and data analysis for the randomized trial, and testing for ATHENA DSS, and we are preparing manuscripts. A new project evaluating implementation of guidelines with ATHENA DSS at 3 VA medical centers began in October, 2000. \n",

      " Background: The purpose of this study is to improve the quality of VA diabetes care using an automated telephone disease management (ATDM) system that administers patient assessments and targeted self-care education between clinic visits. Objectives: In this ongoing study, we are determining: 1) the reliability and validity of Automated Telephone Disease Management (ATDM) assessments of patients' glycemic control, health-related quality of life (HRQL), self-care, and satisfaction with care; 2) the extent to which these assessments identify patients at risk for poor outcomes; and 3) the cost-effectiveness of an intervention in which ATDM assessment reports are provided regularly to patients' primary care providers. Methods: We are refining and expanding previously-developed ATDM assessment instruments by incorporating measures of patient-centered outcomes. We are enrolling 450 patients from VISN 12 and VISN 21. Patients receive weekly ATDM assessments for six months. Other data on their health status and service use are being collected from medical records, laboratory tests, telephone surveys, and Austin Automation Center files. After determining the concurrent reliability, validity, and prognostic significance of the ATDM assessments, we will examine variation in ATDM-reported outcomes across Networks, facilities, and patient groups. In the second phase of the study, we will conduct an effectiveness trial with a one year follow up period. We will use the findings from our process evaluation to modify the ATDM assessments and design provider feedback reports. We will enroll 240 patients from the two Networks (i.e., 480 patients overall). Patients will be assigned to experimental or usual care control groups using a combination of randomization and cutoff-based assignment. We will measure the intervention's impact on patients' glycemic control, symptoms, self-care, and patient-centered outcomes. We will use VA costing database and Medicare claims files to evaluate cost-effectiveness. Status: Analyses of ATDM assessment data suggest that this method is feasible with VA diabetes patients and provides comparable data regarding patients' satisfaction with care and functioning to telephone surveys. Other analysis suggest that VA interpersonal processes of care and rates of cost-related medication adherence problems are as good or better than that experienced by patients with comparable characteristics treated in other systems of care. \n",

Clinical trials have demonstrated that more intensive hypoglycemic medication therapy results in improved glycemic control. Yet quality measures for this critical process of care have not been developed and we know little about how physicians actually manage hypoglycemic medications. Objectives: We propose to develop a quality measure that describes the intensity of physicians' hypoglycemic medication therapy. We will then provide feedback to VA physicians regarding their practices and access to experts in diabetes care to determine whether this intervention leads to improvements in glycemic control. Methods: The study was divided into two phases. During the first phase we used existing data to model the decision to increase hypoglycemic medications. At each medical visit, we determined whether an increase in medication therapy occurred. We then used recursive partitioning to develop a model that identified patient characteristics at the visit, such as recent laboratory results and diagnoses, associated with the decision to increase therapy. This model assigns a predicted probability of an increase in therapy to each visit. We used these predictions to define an intensity of hypoglycemic medication therapy for each physician that compared the actual to predicted number of increases over all patient-visits. The second phase was a randomized trial in which clinicians at experimental sites receive feedback on performance and access to expert opinion while usual care is provided at control sites. Feedback on performance was provided twice over 6 months. The change in intensity of treatment scores and glycosylated hemoglobin levels pre- and post-intervention at these sites were compared to performance of primary care physicians at control sites not receiving the intervention.

Methods: The analysis has four parts. First, it will describe the level of adherence to the indicators in VA HIV patients nationwide and compare VA HIV patients to national benchmarks. Second, it will analyze facility and patient level predictors of adherence to indicators of quality of care and compare them with the predictors in the non VA population using staged logistic regressions. Third, it will seek to validate certain indicators (e.g. HAART therapy) against clinical outcomes like hospitalization and immune status. We will also model the clinical \"price\" that the VA pays in suboptimal clinical outcomes as a result of current performance levels.

Objectives: This project is evaluating a patient-treatment matching strategy to improve residential treatment for substance abuse patients with psychiatric disorders. Its immediate objective is to examine whether the matching strategy results in more effective and cost-effective treatment in VA programs. We hypothesize that patients with severe clinical problems will have better outcomes when they are matched to service-intensive programs; patients with moderate problems will have better outcomes when they are matched to programs having a lower intensity of services. For both patient groups, community treatment should prove to be more cost-effective than hospital treatment. Methods: The project utilized a stratified randomized design. We paired each of three VA hospital programs that treat dual diagnosis patients and are high on intensity with a nearby high-intensity community residential facility (CRF) that contracts with the VA. We also paired four VA hospital and four CRFs that are low on intensity. Veterans who applied for substance abuse treatment at VA facilities were randomly assigned to either the VA hospital or CRF.

While many innovative geriatric care programs exist within VHA, we still lack a systematic process for identifying at-risk elders from the larger VA population who are likely to benefit from specialized geriatric services. Objectives: Our goal is to improve care for at-risk older veterans through a comprehensive system of casefinding, assessment, referral and follow-up within the primary care setting. We hypothesize that subjects receiving this intervention will have more complete evaluation and treatment for selected geriatric conditions (i.e., falls, urinary incontinence, functional status impairments, depression, and cognitive deficits), better continuity of care, less decline in functional status, and better general health than subjects receiving usual care. Methods: This randomized controlled trial is being performed at the Sepulveda VA Outpatient Clinic. The study sample is composed of community-dwelling veterans aged 65 and older who are not receiving VA geriatric services. Veterans are mailed a health screening survey to identify those at risk for decline based on criteria established in pilot work. At-risk respondents who are in the intervention group receive a structured telephone assessment (casefinding) and referral to appropriate geriatric services, including a geriatric assessment and teaching clinic integrated with primary care, and telephone case management. Subjects in the control group receive usual care. Major outcome measures collected by telephone interview at baseline, 12, 24, and 36 months include functional status, self-rated health, satisfaction, and health care utilization.

Automated telephone disease management (ATDM) systems can augment telephone care by providing frequent monitoring and health education to large patient panels while focusing clinicians� attention on individuals who need it most. Although this technology has shown some promise, it has not been rigorously evaluated, particularly in VA. Objectives: This study evaluated Automated Telephone Disease Management (ATDM) calls with telephone nurse follow-up as a means of improving the quality of VA diabetes care. Specifically, we will determine whether this service improves patients' glucose control; improves other important outcomes such as their quality of life, satisfaction with care, and health service use; improves health behaviors such as self-monitoring of blood glucose, fat intake, and medication adherence; and has effects that vary across patient subgroups. Methods: Patients with diabetes mellitus using hypoglycemic medication were enrolled during outpatient visits to a university-affiliated VA health care system and randomized to usual care or bi-weekly ATDM assessment and self-care education calls with follow-up by a nurse educator. The intervention process was evaluated by examining patients� patterns of ATDM use and the reliability and validity of information they provided. Telephone surveys were used to measure intervention effects at 12-months on patients� self-care, symptoms, satisfaction with care, and perceived access barriers. The impact on VA utilization was evaluated using electronic utilization databases, and glycemic control was measured using laboratory tests. A total of 292 patients were randomized and 272 (93%) provided data at 12-months. Intervention patients completed ATDM assessments consistently throughout the observation period and the assessments identified groups of intervention patients with varying degrees of health risk at baseline. Compared to control patients, intervention patients at 12-months reported more frequent glucose self-monitoring, fewer access problems, and greater satisfaction with care (all p = 0.05). Intervention patients were more likely than controls to have been seen in podiatry clinics (53% versus 31%, p = 0.003) and diabetes specialty clinics (31% versus 17%, p = 0.03) during the study. The intervention did not influence mean endpoint HgA1c levels overall. However, among patients with baseline HgA1c = 8%, mean endpoint values among intervention and control patients were 8.7% and 9.2%, respectively (p = 0.05); intervention effects were even greater among patients with baseline HgA1c = 9%. Moreover, intervention patients at follow-up reported fewer symptoms of poor glycemic control than patients receiving usual care (3.6 versus 4.4, p = 0.03). Status: Completed. \n",

A collaborative care model derived from chronic illness management theory has been successful in improving care in other managed care settings. Objectives: This effectiveness study adapted collaborative care to the VA primary care setting (\"collaborative care\") and compared it with consult-liaison care (\"CL care\"). Methods: Patients within a VA primary care clinic were randomly assigned by firm to the two interventions. In collaborative care, existing staff resources were reorganized to form a multidisciplinary mental health specialist team. The team developed a treatment plan based on an initial assessment and suggested the plan to the primary care provider. Primary care providers' treatment efforts were then supported by brief Social Work telephone calls designed to support adherence and monitor symptomatology. Treatment results were systematically reviewed and suggestions for treatment modification were fed back to the primary providers. In CL care, the primary care providers were informed of the diagnosis and study clinicians facilitated referrals to Psychiatry residents in-clinic as requested. Mailed and in-clinic surveys and provider referral were used to recruit 168 collaborative care and 186 CL care patients who met criteria for major depression and/or dysthymia based on structured interview. Patients were excluded only if they required immediate inpatient care, had a pending mental health specialty clinic appointment, or had primary alcohol abuse. Outcome data on the SCL-20 depression symptomatology measure, Veterans SF-36, and Sheehan Disability Scale were collected at baseline, 3 and 9 months. VA utilization and costs of care were analyzed.

      " Background: This study was designed to assess the effectiveness of a Health Education Program (HEP) for improving the well-being and reducing the health care use and cost of care of frail older outpatient veterans, and for improving the well-being of their spouse caregivers. HEP is a multi-component group program delivered in 8 weekly, 2-hour sessions, and 10 monthly 2-hour follow-up sessions, it includes emotion-focused and problem focused coping strategies, education and support. Objectives: The objectives of this study are to evaluate: 1) effects of HEP on the perceived health status, emotional well-being, and social support of frail veterans; 2) effects of HEP on the perceived health, emotional well-being, social support, burden levels, self-appraisal of change, pressing problems associated with caregiving, knowledge and use of community resources by caregiver; and 3) effects of HEP on the health care use and costs of care recipients. Methods: HEP was evaluated using a randomized control group design. The design has two levels of intervention, HEP vs. Usual Care (UC), 3 VA medical centers (VAMCs), and 4 times of measurement (at baseline, after the 8th HEP meeting, and at 1 and 2 years after baseline). Data reported here are for 8 week and 1-year psychosocial outcomes and 18 months for VA cost. Caregivers and veterans (n = 466) were randomized in 3 VAMCs, 114 to UC and 119 to HEP. The typical caregiver was 68 years old, married, white, female, with some college education and living with the veteran. The typical veteran care recipient was 74 years old, white, male with some college education, and suffered from one or more chronic health problems. Fifteen HEP groups were conducted. Caregivers and recipients were assessed on: 1) health and functional status; 2) emotional well-being; and 3) social support. In addition, caregivers were assessed for change in coping skills, change in burden level, pressing problems, and knowledge and use of community resources. Data was analyzed using random effects regression models. Status: Data on two-year outcomes for health and functional status, emotional well-being, and social support of caregivers and veterans, problems associated with caregiving and Medicare plus VA costs are being collected and analyzed for an amended final report. \n",

Moreover, improved cardiorespiratory reserve may decrease the utilization of health care resources during mild to moderate exacerbation of COPD. Objectives: The overall goal of this project is to determine whether exercise training leads to a reduction in chronic institutionalization, acute hospitalization, and outpatient physician visits and to improved functional status and QOL in patients with COPD. The following specific objectives will be accomplished: 1) test the hypothesis that the addition of exercise training to usual care reduces use of health care services over a one-year follow-up period; and 2) test the hypothesis that exercise training leads to improvements in functional status and QOL. Methods: Hypotheses will be tested by means of a randomized controlled trial involving subjects with COPD (aged 50-79 years) who receive care at two Boston area VA hospitals. Subjects randomized to the intervention group receive an eight-week program of thrice-weekly exercise training sessions. Outcomes include a standardized QOL questionnaire and objective tests of functional status (6-minute walk and activities of daily living performance). Status: Subject recruitment and interventions completed; data collection completed; currently analyzing data on effects of intervention on health care utilization and other parameters. \n",

The occupational therapy assessment uses the Allen Cognitive Levels that identify the abilities and deficits of a particular functional level so that the strategies and approaches taught to caregivers can be tailored to the specific needs of the patient. Objectives: The ultimate objective of the study is to increase caregiver competence, maintain optimal function of dementia patients, and show that this nurse managed clinical model can improve the quality of life for both the Alzheimer patients and their caregivers in a cost-effective manner. Methods: The study is being conducted as a block design, randomized trial of the Dementia Care Clinic (DCC) compared with the standard interdisciplinary GRECC care. A total of 120 dementia patient/spouse caregiver dyads will be enrolled in the study. Twelve dyads are enrolled in each seven-week block during which a clinic visit and four weekly caregiver education sessions are held for each of the two cohort groups. Follow up clinic visits are made at six months and one year. Data collection interviews are conducted before the first clinic visit, and at three, six, and twelve months. Patient depressed mood is measured by the Yesavage Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). The Revised Memory and Behavior Problems Checklist is used to measure patient behavior changes and the effect of the behaviors on the caregiver. Positive and negative effects of caregiving are measured by the Zarit Burden Interview, the Center of Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), Phillips Beliefs about Caregiving Scale, and brief scales of perceived mastery, preparedness, and competence in caregiving. The project will employ multiple independent repeated measures analyses of covariance (RMANCOVA) in which pre-intervention levels of the dependent measures under consideration will be controlled as covariates. Group x time interaction effects will also be examined to test for changing effects of the intervention over the study period. Multiple regression analyses will be used to examine the relationship of cost data to subject and experimental factors. Status: Recruitment was completed for the study in 2000. Each cohort of patients and their spouse caregivers have been followed for one year. Baseline data is being analyzed and portions have been presented at recent conferences. Study data is currently being analyzed and analysis is scheduled for completion in December of 2001. \n",

Nurses have one of the highest incidences of work related back injuries of any profession. Over the past 20 years, efforts to reduce work-related injuries in nursing have been largely unsuccessful. Objectives: The goal of this study is to reduce the incidence and severity of occupational musculoskeletal injuries in nursing through the redesign of stressful patient handling tasks. This study addresses three objectives: 1) conduct a quantitative, biomechanically based, ergonomic evaluation of the eleven \"at risk\" tasks in nursing practice; 2) redesign the techniques or equipment needed to perform these tasks safely or with reduced risk of musculoskeletal injury; and 3) conduct laboratory- based assessment of the biomechanical benefit of the proposed intervention strategies. Methods: Using a randomized experimental design with a control group, ten \"at risk\" tasks will be evaluated. The sample included 160 experienced nursing staff. Data were collected using: 1) Caregiver Data Form and Anthropometry Data Sheet; 2) 3-D Electromagnetic Tracking System; 3) EMG; and 4) modified Borg Scale for Perceived Comfort. Include: caregiver characteristics, joint torque, spinal forces, spinal tolerance limit and damage load limit, erector spinae surface EMG, joint angles, percent of population capable of performing each task by gender, velocity of lift, reach, heart rate, and perceived comfort.

When they are unable to verbalize pain, objective measurement of their discomfort are possible manifestations of pain. No research relates systemic pain treatment with reduction of negative problematic behaviors in patient dementia. Objectives: The objectives of this research are (1) to elucidate the relationships between pain, discomfort, and agitation; and (2) to determine the influence that pain management has on decreasing the outcomes of discomfort, agitation, and confusion in nursing home residents. Methods: This study used a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design. Each treatment arm lasted two weeks. The crossover point occurred without washout. One arm was acetaminophen 650 mg qid and placebo qid PRN. The other arm was placebo qid and acetaminophen 650 mg qid PRN. Sites involved in the study included the Jewish Home for the Aged in San Francisco; Golden Gate Healthcare Center in San Francisco; Palo Alto VA Health Care System; Nursing Home Care Unit at Livermore. Patients were included who: are > 55 years; have severe dementia; have a documented painful condition not requiring opiates or a current medication regimen; unable to report pain consistently or reliably; be present and accept treatment for study duration; have > 1 episode of agitation per day. Patients with schizophrenia or severe Parkinson�s are excluded. A research assistant (blind to treatment arm) tested each patient for discomfort, agitation, and confusion at baseline and two times per day on two days of the week for four weeks. Nurses rated patients for agitation each shift. Instruments included the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory, the Discomfort Scale, and the Confusion Assessment Method. Repeated measures analyses examined effect of treatment on the three behaviors (agitation, confusion, and discomfort). Status: The study is complete.

      " Background: Nurses play an important role in helping patients to manage symptoms, adhere to treatment, and change behavior. There has been a lack of research regarding nonpharmacologic interventions with patients with heart failure and other chronic conditions. Objectives: The primary objective of this 4-year study was to determine the effect of a nurse-led behavioral management intervention on health-related quality in patients with medically-managed heart failure. The secondary objective was to assess the impact of the behavioral management intervention on health care resource utilization. Methods: DESIGN: randomized controlled trial. SETTING: single site, VA San Diego Healthcare System. SAMPLE: Patients were enrolled in 11 cohorts a total of 116 outpatients were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups to evaluate the clinical impact of the intervention. Group 1 received usual care for patients with heart failure (n=58). Group 2 was an augmented group receiving usual care plus participation in the 15-week (4-month) behavioral management program (n=58). Inclusion criteria were that the patient had a primary diagnosis of heart failure, a VA primary care provider, stable symptoms for at least one month and was able to walk. INTERVENTION: The behavioral management program augmented usual care and consisted of establishing specific goals with patients related to healthier diet, increased quality and amount of exercise, smoking cessation, and increased social and interpersonal activities. DEPENDENT VARIABLES/OUTCOME MEASURES: The five major dependent variables for this study were psychological symptom distress (Multiple Affect Adjective Check List - MAACL), physical functioning (SF-36 physical component summary score), mental functioning (SF-36 mental component summary score), exercise capability (6-Minute Walk), and general health perceptions (SF-36 general health scale score).

Objectives: The specific aim was to compare functional status (FS), quality of life (QOL) and autonomic tone in 2 groups of advanced HF patients (nurse-managed home walking exercise (HWE) group vs. control group). Methods: A randomized controlled trial comparing a 12-week nurse-managed progressive HWE protocol to usual activity was conducted in 79 HF patients (78[99%] male; mean age 62.6 � 10.6 years; EF 27 � 8.8%; 63 [80%] NYHA II, 15[20%] NYHA III-IV; HF duration 39.2 � 41.8 months) from a VA medical center and a university affiliated medical center. The 12- week HWE program is once a day, 5x a week and initiated at 10 minutes and progressively increases in duration and intensity up to 60 minutes.

      " Background: Cancer pain is a pervasive problem for the person with cancer. Despite advances in knowledge, effective cancer management is infrequently achieved. While this problem is multi-factorial, the patient may have attitudinal barriers to effective pain management that can be ameliorated with novel interventions. Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to determine the effects of two nursing interventions on the improvement of pain management (PM), functional status (FS) and quality of life (QOL) in veterans receiving cancer care in VA ambulatory care clinics. The two interventions will utilize selected cancer pain management strategies developed as Clinical Practice Guidelines by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR). This study will test the hypothesis that those veterans in the intervention arms will have lower pain intensity scores, greater pain relief and satisfaction with PM, and will have higher QOL and FS scores specifically in the areas of physical and social functioning. A secondary aim is to measure the extent that cancer PM is affected by the intervening variables of age, affect, attitudinal barriers, veteran culture, type/stage of disease, and type of cancer treatment. Methods: The design of this randomized trial has one between-subjects factor, GROUP, with three levels (usual care, structured education, individualized coaching), and one within-subjects factor, TIME, with two measures, pre-test and post-test. Patients with cancer pain (n=320) are randomly assigned to one of three groups after stratifications to control for the confounding variables of pain intensity and effects of cancer treatment. Those in the structured education arm view a video on cancer pain management and receive the AHCPR patient pamphlet on cancer pain management. Those subjects in the individualized coaching arm receive the same structured education as above, but also partake in four telephone coaching sessions focusing on the individual's specific pain management problems. The primary outcome variables measured after 12 weeks are: satisfaction with pain management, quality of life and functional status. Status: The project is in the final phase of data analysis and writing the final report. A total of 322 subjects were recruited: 289 eligible patients completed the Pre-test and 227 completed the Post-Test. Two papers are approximately 75% written. The main study paper is in the planning stage, to be completed after the final report is submitted. \n",

The purpose of this research is to develop and evaluate the efficacy of a HT CD-ROM decision-aid in improving the decision making process for women considering the use of estrogen HT. Objectives: The objectives of the study are to: 1) develop a model of the decision-making process for postmenopausal women considering hormone (HT), based on Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT); 2) produce an interactive CD-ROM decision-aid for HT; 3) evaluate the effect of the interactive CD-ROM decision-aid on patient satisfaction with decision (SWD) and knowledge about menopause and HT; and 4) test the effect of the interactive CD-ROM decision-aid on women�s decisions regarding use of HT. Methods: Phase I (completed) used structured interviews and surveys in the development of a decision model for HT. In phase II, an interactive CD-ROM decision-aid was developed and a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of its effect on decision processes was conducted. Postmenopausal women, aged 45-74 were recruited from the primary care clinics of the four participating Veterans Affairs hospitals: Milwaukee, Madison, Chicago-Hines, and Chicago-Westside. The primary hypothesis was that women who use the CD-ROM decision-aid would demonstrate increased satisfaction with their decision regarding hormone replacement therapy use compared to women receiving the control intervention. Status: Enrollment and follow-up assessments have been completed. The study is in the analysis phase. The study was presented to the VA HSR&D Combined Monitoring Board on February 5, 2003 and the committee voted unanimously to recommend continuation of the trial.

Methods: The study was a randomized controlled trial, conducted at two clinic firms at a VA Medical Center in Chicago. Eligible patients were men, age 50 and older, had no personal or family history of colorectal cancer or polyps, had not received colorectal cancer screening, and had at least one visit to the clinic during the study period. Health care providers in the intervention firm attended a workshop on colorectal cancer screening. Every 4-6 months they attended quality improvement workshops where they received group screening rates, individualized confidential feedback, and training on improving communication with patients with limited literacy skills. Medical records were reviewed for colorectal cancer screening recommendations and completion. Literacy level was assessed in a subset of patients.

      " Background: Newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer patients face difficult decisions about treatment and management; including radiation therapy, radical prostatectomy, brachytherapy, and observation. Previous studies have cited patient preference and physician recommendation for treatment as major roles in treatment decisions. Objectives: This grant will be used to develop and evaluate a decision analysis based intervention to improve decision-making among veterans with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer. While the ultimate goal of this study is to improve decision-making among these patients, factors influencing physician recommendations for treatment will be sought. The former will be achieved by evaluating the efficacy of providing physicians with information incorporating patient preference for alternative health states with probabilities of treatment outcomes. Factors influencing physician recommendations for treatment will be determined through qualitative interviews with physicians.

Upon consent for participation in the study, comorbidities, histologic grade of the biopsy, and age were obtained for 13 patients with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer. Using a standard gamble technique, interviewers obtained patient utilities for 5 distinct health states related to prostate cancer treatment. Clinical and pathologic characteristics were incorporated into the decision analytic model, and the derived quality-adjusted life expectancies (QALEs) were shared with the treating urologist before patient-physician discussion of treatment options. The feasibility of the decision analytic intervention and unbiased estimates of the impact of the intervention was evaluated. The long-range objective of this proposal is to design an intervention for veterans that increases physician understanding of patient treatment preferences and patient understanding of choices in prostate cancer treatment.

      " Smoking cessation interventions including behavioral and pharmacological components have been demonstrated to be both effective and cost-effective. Although there is a high prevalence of smoking and smoking-related disorders among veterans who use VA medical centers for health care, rates of identification of tobacco use and provision of brief and/or intensive smoking cessation services are suboptimal. Telephone outreach (TO) may serve to increase access to counseling and medications to assist smoking cessation. From the standpoint of health systems, TO provides the opportunity for centralized oversight and quality assurance, economy of scale, and dissemination strategies that are practical to implement.

At the provider level, TO addresses barriers to delivery of services such as limited time and skills. From the standpoint of the smoker, attractions of TO include accessibility, convenience, and privacy. Objectives: The objectives of the study are to: 1) determine if TO increases successful quitting among veterans who smoke, compared to the distribution of written self-help materials; and 2) determine the cost-effectiveness of TO for smoking cessation for veterans who smoke. Methods: The study involved a population-based sample of veterans in VISN 13 who use one of the five Network VAMCs for primary care. 838 smokers were recruited, enrolled and randomly assigned to 1) written self-help materials + TO, or 2) written self-help materials alone. The behavioral intervention protocol included follow-up calls scheduled in a relapse-sensitive fashion. Use of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) was encouraged, and prescriptions facilitated. Data was collected at baseline, 3 months, and 12 months by telephone. Information on demographic characteristics, medical and mental health histories, smoking history, intervention, and use of clinical services for smoking cessation was included. Cost data will be calculated from administrative databases, and will include 1) written materials, 2) counseling (personnel time, equipment, space), and 3) medications. The primary outcome was 6 months of prolonged abstinence from smoking, measured 12 months following intervention. Secondary analyses evaluated 3 month and 12 month point prevalent abstinence from smoking, quit attempts, and a formal cost-effectiveness analysis that will include total costs, total and marginal effects and cost-effectiveness ratios (average cost/quit and average cost/marginal quit) for TO and SH interventions. Status: Data collection and main outcome analyses have been completed. The main manuscript will be submitted to JAMA in October 2004. We are starting cost-effectiveness analyses. \n",

      " More that 20% of patients in primary care have depressive disorders. While primary care is the principal venue for treatment for depression, fewer than 25% of depressed patients receive adequate treatment for their depression. These outcomes can be worse when there are barriers to treatment such as living in a rural area. Several studies have found that given a choice, about two-thirds of depressed primary care patients prefer psychotherapy or counseling over antidepressant medication. This is a controlled, randomized trial in which subjects meeting criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) from primary care settings in VISN 21 including CBOCs will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions: 1) a 16-session manualized telephone administered cognitive behavioral therapy (T-CBT) delivered over 24 weeks or 2) a treatment-as-usual (TAU) condition. Telephone-administered cognitive behavioral therapy (T-CBT) is an intervention aimed at improving coping skills and social functioning. It is divided into two phases: 1) an initial treatment phase consisting of 12 weekly sessions aimed at reducing symptoms of depression, and 2) a booster phase in which 4 sessions are provided at increasingly greater intervals to target maintenance of treatment gains. T-CBT, administered by doctoral level psychologists, will be compared to a treatment-as-usual (TAU) condition that controls for the natural course of depression during the course of treatment. \n",

Given the press of national initiatives and local incentives to improve smoking cessation care in response to VA performance measures, this study tests a widely applicable approach to clinical practice guidelines implementation, namely evidence-based quality improvement, which is directly relevant to the translation of efficacious treatments into enhancements in VA health care policy and practice. Evidence-Based Quality Improvement (EBQI) focuses on improved provider adherence to smoking cessation guidelines and a decrease in patient smoking rates in a manner designed to produce short- and long-term health improvements and cost benefits at the organizational level. Objectives: Adherence to smoking cessation guidelines requires practice changes at the patient, provider, and system levels to achieve optimal quit rates. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of evidence-based quality improvement (EBQI)�an expert-designed and locally implemented clinical reorganization of smoking cessation care�on changes in smoking cessation (SC) practice among primary care providers and health outcomes among veteran smokers. Methods: An evidence-based quality improvement intervention comprising provision of physician and patient educational materials, local priority setting with leadership and providers, and local adaptation of expert-designed protocols was implemented in experimental VA primary care practices (n=9). VA control sites (n=9), matched on size and academic affiliation, received smoking cessation guideline copies. We randomly sampled, consented, screened and surveyed primary care patients at all 18 sites (n=1,941 smokers) and used computer-assisted telephone interviewing to assess sociodemographics, health status, function, and smoking behavior, attitudes and treatment experience. Post-intervention 12-month follow-up interviews were completed using the same measures (n=1,080). We used multiple imputation using hotdeck techniques and applied both enrollment and attrition weights to the patient-level data. We used weighted logistic regression to evaluate intervention effects, controlling for patient-level predictors of quit attempts and quit status (e.g., level of addiction, readiness to change, age, health). Status: The project is completed. Analysis is ongoing for manuscripts. \n",

      " Background: Schizophrenia, a chronic psychiatric disorder, is the second most frequent VA discharge diagnosis. Medication management practices for schizophrenia often are not guideline-concordant and place patients at risk for adverse outcomes. This project tests a new strategy to standard implementation for VHA Schizophrenia Guidelines. Objectives: Research objectives are: (1) to compare the effectiveness of a conceptually-based, enhanced intervention to that of a basic educational strategy with regard to improving guideline adherence and patient compliance; (2) to compare the effectiveness of the two strategies with regard to improving symptom and side effect outcomes; (3) to determine the effect of the enhanced intervention on service utilization for acute exacerbations of schizophrenia; (4) to determine the extent to which guideline-concordant medication management improves patient outcomes; and (5) to examine providers' knowledge of and attitudes toward guidelines. Methods: Thirteen VA sites were considered for the study, and VistA data were extracted to assess baseline guideline performance. Seven sites were selected and received basic education about schizophrenia guidelines. Three of these sites were randomly selected to receive the enhanced intervention, employing a nurse coordinator to promote providers' guideline adherence and patients' treatment adherence. Subjects with an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia were enrolled and were interviewed at baseline and six months using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, the Schizophrenia Outcomes Module, and the Barnes Akathisia Scale. Data on guideline adherence were collected from medical records and VistA files. When data collection is completed, analyses will be conducted to determine the effectiveness of the enhanced intervention with regard to improving guideline adherence and patient outcomes. Status: The project is ongoing. To date, 401 subjects have been enrolled in the intervention study. The rate of completed follow-up assessments to date is 86 percent. \n",

The VHA has encouraged adoption of the AHCPR Guideline for Smoking Cessation, yet most hospitals have poorly developed smoking cessation programs. Objectives: The present study is designed to investigate the effectiveness of an organizational strategy to increase compliance with the AHCPR guideline. Short term goals of the study include increasing the rate of identification of smokers and increasing the delivery of brief smoking cessation interventions. Long term goals include reducing tobacco consumption among veterans. Methods: Twenty VAMC�s with active primary care clinics have been randomly assigned to either control (usual practice; UP) or intervention (organizational support; OS) groups. The intervention hospitals receive staff training and site consultation; all hospitals will receive the AHCPR guideline. Rate of identification of smokers in the medical record, smoking cessation rates, provision of smoking cessation services (e.g., NRT, counseling), and costs of NRT will be determined via telephone interviews with patients, chart review, and electronic records. Status: Baseline data collection is nearly complete, and the intervention period will be complete in September, 2000. We have completed telephone surveys with approximately 4500 veterans.

Therefore, the main objective is to understand the impact of a tailored education message program designed for direct use by patients on medical resource use. Other objectives include understanding the tools impact on patient compliance and quality of life. Methods: Patients have been randomized to one of two groups: 1) intervention group or the 2) control group. The intervention group receives the tailored education messages program. This program assesses patients� beliefs about compliance with medications, diet, and self-monitoring. Based on identified barriers to compliance, intervention patients receive a tailored educational message to dispel these beliefs and improve compliance. The control group interacts with a generic healthcare website.

Heart failure is a serious condition for which compliance with established guidelines is suboptimal. Physicians� compliance with heart failure guidelines may improve if such reminders use symptom and history data. Objectives: 1) Program standard computer-based guidelines for heart failure using data from the electronic medical record systems at the Indianapolis and Seattle VAMCs. 2) Establish a system for capturing data on symptoms and history from heart failure patients before scheduled primary care visits. 3) Incorporate these data into enhanced computer reminders. 4) Conduct a randomized, controlled trial comparing these two types of reminders� effects on physician prescribing, patient objective and subjective outcomes, and health care utilization. Methods: This controlled trial targets patients with objective evidence of left ventricular dysfunction on cardiac imaging studies and a current outpatient diagnosis of heart failure. Primary care physicians in the Indianapolis and Seattle VAMCs have been randomized to receive either standard heart failure treatment reminders or reminders enhanced by history/symptom data. Study data come from the VAMCs electronic medical record systems (i.e., clinical data, utilization, and costs) and patient interviews (heart failure symptoms and medication compliance, heart failure-specific quality of life, and patients� satisfaction with their primary care). Data analysis will be performed at the patient level using general estimating equations to account for patient and physician characteristics and clustering of patients within physicians. Status: Data Collection: Enrollment has been completed, with 503 patients enrolled from the Roudebush VAMC in Indianapolis and 250 from the VA Puget Sound Health Care System in Seattle. The trial continues without irregularities in both places. More than 80 percent of eligible patients were enrolled from both sites.

      " Background: It is estimated that the VHA is caring for nearly 40 percent of all HIV-infected veterans. To benefit from recent improvements in anti-HIV therapy, patients need to take their medications consistently. Objectives: Optimizing health for HIV patients requires excellent adherence to antiretroviral medication regimens. However, its unclear how best to incorporate adherence education and support programs into VA HIV outpatient care. We implemented and evaluated a pharmacist program (ACE) and a Pager reminder program to support adherence in veterans with HIV. Methods: We used a quasi-experimental design with pre-post evaluation at four VA Centers. Three treatment conditions (ACE, Pager, Usual Care) were rolled-in sequentially over two study phases, allowing for group comparisons between conditions. ACE is a multi-component manualized 4-session, individual patient education and support program by trained pharmacists. The Pager intervention used alphanumeric pagers to remind patients of dosing times. Electronically-monitored medication adherence (MEMS), self-report questionnaires, and pharmacy refill records were collected. Qualitative site interviews were collected before and after interventions to assist with program evaluation. Multilevel mixed models were used to analyze main study outcomes over time.

Data from CDC-funded study to assess falls among the elderly (SAFE) suggest that as many as 41 percent of elderly patients fall at home in the year following discharge from hospitalization due in part to deconditioning associated with inactivity. Objectives: The controlled trial of a physical restoration (PR) intervention (Geriatric Rehabilitation Intensive Program, SAFE-GRIP) is designed to improve physical functional capacity and to reduce the likelihood of falls in the elderly during the period following discharge from hospitalization or inactivity/bed rest. Methods: This is a four year randomized trial of SAFE-GRIP, designed to improve the physical functional capacity, to reduce the likelihood of falls and to decrease the chance of injury from falls. Patients at home or recently discharged to home will be randomly assigned to one of two groups, PR or control, upon receiving medical clearance (time=0). This project will provide mechanisms to establish well-designed innovative physical restoration (PR) protocols for the Miami VAMC and test the effects of these interventions on the rate of falling/sustaining injuries and their sequelae at home. Our anticipated sample was 105 males and 105 females aged 60+ years inactive at home or recently discharged to home from the Miami VAMC and a neighboring community hospital. Study participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups, PR or control, upon receiving medical clearance. Baseline measures of physical function, health care utilization, ADL/IADL performance and health-related quality of life will be taken following assignment to treatment conditions. These same measures will be taken again at eight weeks following medical clearance, and again at six months. The incidence of falls will be tracked throughout the funding period for each subject. Self-report of the number of falls in the year prior to hospitalization, an assessment of in-home hazards, and an assessment of participants' post-hospitalization medication regimen will be obtained at the baseline assessment and used as covariates in the analysis of outcomes.

      " Background: Post-traumatic stress disorder is a mental health problem of enormous proportion within the VA system for both male and female veterans. The 40 percent of veterans with PTSD and concurrent clinically significant depression are particularly difficult to treat. Effective and efficient treatment of veterans with this combination of disorders would be of benefit to a significant number of veterans. Objectives: Well-validated treatments of PTSD and its complications are rare. There are no studies of treatment addressing the sequelae of chronic PTSD, including depressive symptomatology. Our study is the first randomized, controlled study of group psychosocial interventions for the combination of PTSD and depression in male and female veterans. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the impact of two psychosocial interventions on clinical outcomes and on the use of hospital resources by veterans with these co-existing disorders. Methods: Male and female veterans with both PTSD and depressive diagnoses will be recruited for the study. Male veterans must have combat-related PTSD, and female veterans will have trauma related to sexual assault. Veterans will be randomly assigned to either Self-Management Therapy (Rehm, 1984), a cognitive-behavioral treatment program for depression, or to a Psychoeducational Group Therapy (Dunn, et al., 1998). Both programs involve short-term group therapies that teach veterans about their disorders, and provide them with new strategies and skills for overcoming them. These therapy groups will be in addition to other standard care that veterans receive within the Trauma Recovery Program at the Houston VA Medical Center. Approximately 120 male veterans and 60 female veterans will be enrolled in the program.

Effectively implementing the guideline will enhance the quality, appropriateness, timeliness, and cost effectiveness of care delivered to veterans with ischemic heart disease. Objectives: The long-term objective of this study is to identify the best strategies for implementing the IHD guidelines to improve guideline adherence and provider acceptance. The specific objectives of the study are to: 1) describe the temporal aspects of guideline acceptance and adherence over three periods of time: pre-implementation, post-implementation of general strategies, and post- implementation of targeted strategies; 2) assess the relative effectiveness of targeted intervention strategies on guideline adherence; 3) identify the relationships among provider beliefs, attitudes, and their intentions to use guidelines; 4) identify the costs associated with implementation of general and targeted implementation strategies; and 5) describe provider satisfaction with targeted implementation strategies. Methods: Qualitative (focus groups, interviews with key informants) and quantitative methods (surveys, chart reviews) are used to address study objectives. A survey will be sent to providers to measure beliefs and attitudes that predict provider acceptance to clinical practice guidelines. Patient level data will be collected from reviews of charts from each facility. Based on provider focus groups we will design targeted strategies to overcome system barriers and address needs identified by providers to support clinical practice guideline implementation. A randomized trial will be conducted to assess the relative effectiveness of the targeted intervention strategies. Status: Data collection has ended.

      "Title = Computer-Assisted Access to Specialist Expertise.\n",
      " The goal of this research was to determine if providing specialist input to primary care providers (PCPs) by means of informal consultation could improve the process and outcomes of care for diabetes. Several studies support the role for specialists and their specific knowledge and expertise in a variety of disorders including diabetes. A variety of methods have been designed to optimize the use of specialty expertise including practice guidelines and disease management approaches as well as the consultation/referral process. The referral-consultation process is an important mechanism for obtaining clinically useful information. At one end of the spectrum of this process, informal consultation involves discussion about a patient with a colleague without the consultant seeing the patient; at the other end of the spectrum, care of the patient is transferred to another physician and the process is formalized. Because much specialist expertise resides in the specialists themselves, the expansion of primary care sites to include community-based outpatient clinics has implications for access to the specialists located elsewhere. This study was designed to evaluate a computer-assisted voice mail system which is relatively inexpensive and more convenient than video-telemedicine systems, making it more practical and more easily exportable.

      " Background: The goal of this research was to determine if providing specialist input to primary care providers (PCPs) by means of informal consultation could improve the process and outcomes of care for diabetes. Several studies support the role for specialists and their specific knowledge and expertise in a variety of disorders including diabetes. A variety of methods have been designed to optimize the use of specialty expertise including practice guidelines and disease management approaches as well as the consultation/referral process. The referral-consultation process is an important mechanism for obtaining clinically useful information. At one end of the spectrum of this process, informal consultation involves discussion about a patient with a colleague without the consultant seeing the patient; at the other end of the spectrum, care of the patient is transferred to another physician and the process is formalized. Because much specialist expertise resides in the specialists themselves, the expansion of primary care sites to include community-based outpatient clinics has implications for access to the specialists located elsewhere. This study was designed to evaluate a computer-assisted voice mail system which is relatively inexpensive and more convenient than video-telemedicine systems, making it more practical and more easily exportable. Diabetes care delivery was chosen as the model in which to assess informal consultation based on its frequency among veterans, management challenges, and the emphasis on improvement in diabetes care in VA. A secondary goal of the project was to better characterize the consultation process. Objectives: Patients with diabetes mellitus are complex and may benefit from the input of multiple specialists and PCPs must determine the need for and coordinate the input from those multiple specialists. With that in mind, the three objectives of the study are: 1) To assess the impact of computer-assisted access to specialist expertise (CASE) on process of care for patients with diabetes mellitus; 2) To assess the impact of CASE on outcomes of care at the patient level (clinical outcomes and satisfaction), provider level (satisfaction) and the system level (health services utilization and costs); and 3) To characterize the consultation-referral process in community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs). Methods: Randomized controlled trial with access to the CASE system constituting the intervention and a descriptive study of the consultation process. The major outcome variables will be the consultation type, adherence to diabetes practice guidelines, clinical outcome of diabetes care (glycemic control), patient and provider satisfaction. Status: Project work has been completed. The final report has been submitted. \n",

      " Background: Health care organizations, including the VA, are investing substantial effort to improve quality of care. As part of this process, greater emphasis is being placed on measurement of outcomes, and in particular, functional outcomes and satisfaction as reported by patients. Objectives: ACQUIP was designed to determine whether quality and outcomes of health care improve when primary care providers have access to regular assessments of their patients' health and function along with routine clinical data and information about clinical guidelines. Methods: This study was a randomized trial conducted at the General Internal Medicine Clinics of seven VA facilities. Each participating GIMC is organized into discrete firms staffed by different groups of providers who care for different patients. One randomly selected firm received the intervention and one served as control. Patients who made at least one GIMC visit in the last year were eligible to participate. Patients were surveyed at baseline to determine active medical problems. Subsequent mailings included a general evaluation of health status (SF-36), a satisfaction questionnaire and, as appropriate, one of six condition-specific questionnaires: the Seattle Angina Questionnaire, the Seattle Obstructive Lung Disease Questionnaire, the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (depression), and questionnaires regarding diabetes, drinking, and hypertension. Clinical/utilization data were downloaded weekly from VISTA and supplemented with data from Austin. The intervention consisted of multi-faceted reports to patients' primary care providers (at the time of patient visits) showing trended physiologic and health status data and guideline-derived recommendations. Clinicians also received periodical reports displaying trends in the health status and satisfaction of their patients compared with their clinic as a whole. Reports were supplemented by training on QI and health status measures. Status: Data collection was completed on April 1, 2000. Analysis of trial results will be completed January, 2001. \n",

      " Background: Adverse drug events (ADE) present a unique focus for error reduction. Computerized provider order entry, with embedded clinical decision support, has great promise in reducing medication errors but preventable adverse drug events may still occur despite such systems. Objectives: The purpose of the study was to evaluate whether adding medication profiling (by using a retrospective drug utilization review program) to computerized provider order entry with embedded order checks (drug alerts) reduces the incidence of adverse drug events. Methods: Medication profiles mainly focused on possible drug-drug and drug-disease interactions, with some drug duplications. To do the medication profiles we licensed a proprietary computerized retrospective drug utilization review system. We randomly assigned over 900 patients to Usual Care or Provider Feedback. For patients in the latter group, selected providers were contacted by letter with pertinent information; electronic mail was used for follow-up contact. Clinical and other relevant data was retrospectively abstracted from the medical records for up to one year from the last medication profile for all patients. This was done by a pharmacist reviewer, using a study-derived instrument, and blinded to patient assignment. ADE incidence is the primary outcome of interest, with other outcomes such as ADE severity and preventability also assessed. We also developed and implemented provider surveys in pre- and post-profiling periods. Status: Pre and post survey results published. Adjunct study on clinical actions as a result of drug alerts published. Main study (profiling): manuscript in proces. \n",

      " Background: Sleep-activity rhythm disturbance is a prevalent, disabling symptom in cognitively-impaired (CI) elders. Their nocturnal sleep is light and inefficient with frequent awakenings. Multiple short daytime napping episodes interfere with daytime activity and functioning. Daytime disruptive behaviors, such as pacing, hitting, and cursing are related significantly to sleep-activity rhythm disturbance. Medical treatment for sleep and behavior disturbances with benzodiazepines or antipsychotic medications has proven minimally effective and has serious side effects such as impairments in cognition, memory, coordination, and balance, tolerance and severe rebound insomnia, and tardive dyskinesia. Objectives: The degree of daytime sleepiness in elders may reflect a reduction in the purposive physical, cognitive, and affective activities that previously sustained daytime alertness and promoted psychological well-being. For some institutionalized elders, living in a physically, cognitively, and emotionally understimulating setting may induce excessive napping during the day with a subsequent adverse impact on circadian sleep-wake patterns. Concrete, reality-based activities may counter napping by keeping residents with dementia involved in the world around them and helping them meet psychological, physical, and social needs. Our pilot study with five nursing home residents demonstrated that activities timed to occur during usual naptime and tailored to residents� interests and their remaining abilities improved nocturnal sleep. Our other research has shown that engaging residents in meaningful activity improved their psychological well-being and decreased certain types of disruptive behaviors. Methods: We tested the effect of an Individualized Activity Intervention timed to occur when the resident usually napped in the daytime on nocturnal sleep as measured by actigraphy in CI nursing home residents. Examples of individualized activities include objects for tactile and visual stimulation, arts and crafts, and games. We also tested the effect of the intervention on psychological well-being and disruptive behavior, and measured its cost. After the collection of baseline sleep, disruptive behavior, and psychological well-being data for five days, residents were randomly assigned to the Individualized Activity Intervention or to a usual care control condition for 21 days. On days 17-21, the research assistant repeated the outcome measures. Status: Secondary data analysis on psychological well-being, disruptive behavior, and cost of the intervention is in progress. \n",

      " Background: Many elderly primary care patients are at high risk for health complications and functional impairment due to low levels of physical activity. Previous trials of counseling of elderly patients in primary care clinics have not demonstrated lasting physical activity change and have not evaluated fitness changes associated with any increased activity. Objectives: The primary objective was to determine if nurse telephone counseling could assist 60 to 80 year old VA primary care patients to establish and maintain a regular walking program. Methods: In this randomized clinical trial, 60-80 year old patients were referred to a walking program by primary care providers. All participants received individualized counseling by the nurse and, over the next year, one of three follow-up interventions: 1) 20 calls initiated by the nurse; 2) ten calls initiated by the nurse and ten initiated by an automated telephone message delivery system; or 3) no follow-up calls. All kept walking diaries and mailed these in to a data collector blinded to intervention group. Follow-up research visits were scheduled at six and 12 months. Self-reported walking, the primary outcome measure, was assessed from the walking diaries and validated by reports of significant others and accelerometer data. Improvement in fitness was assessed at 12 months with a standardized six minute walking test. Tinetti mobility scores, body mass index, and body girths were also assessed.

Interventions to improve diabetes care by educating providers and patients have been disappointing. In the past several years, case management has been widely advocated as a cost-effective approach to coordinate diabetes care and improve outcomes, although there is little rigorous evidence demonstrating the benefits of this type of intervention. Objectives: This study had the following specific aims: 1) to evaluate the effect of a targeted, proactive case management intervention for high risk veterans with type 2 diabetes on: a) glycemic control, b) intermediate cardiovascular outcomes, c) satisfaction, d) adherence to specific care standards, and e) short-term resource utilization; and 2) using Monte Carlo simulation models, to estimate the expected impact of changes in key processes of care and intermediate outcomes on end-stage outcomes. Methods: This study was conducted as a prospective randomized controlled trial. Participating veterans with diabetes (N = 246) receiving care at two VAMCs were randomly assigned, stratified by site and baseline hemoglobin A1c (A1c), to the intervention or control group. The intervention consisted of two nurse practitioners who actively monitored and coordinated patient care, guided by approved treatment algorithms. Data for the study were collected through a baseline and exit examination, a baseline and exit survey, and the VA medical information system. The primary outcome measure was the change in glycemic control, as measured by A1c. Secondary outcomes included serum LDL, blood pressure, satisfaction, and resource utilization.

While this model has some intuitive appeal in terms of its potential for decreasing health care costs, it may not be applicable in VA medical centers, where patients are often medically complex and socioeconomically vulnerable. Thus, other strategies to integrate generalist and specialist care are required. Objectives: Our objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of an integrated model of primary care for veterans with alcohol dependence and/or depression in which mental health clinical nurse specialists (CNS) are placed within the General Medicine Clinic (GMC). Our primary outcomes are patients� disease-specific mental health symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory: BDI) and satisfaction with care (RAND). Secondary outcomes include quality of care, health services utilization, and health care costs. Methods: This is a randomized, controlled trial comparing patients in two GMC firms. After physicians in both firms were trained in the diagnosis and brief treatment of the two conditions, the two firms were randomized into one of two conditions. Patients in both firms are screened for depression. Patients who screen positive for depression and give written informed consent are enrolled. In the control firm, depression screening results are provided to the primary care physician. In the integrated primary care firm, results are shared with the primary care provider, along with having a mental health clinical nurse specialist in the GMC who is available to implement and support treatment decisions. Telephone interviews are conducted at three and 12 months after enrollment to collect outcome data by persons blinded to the study hypotheses. Data will also be collected using local VA databases. Data analysis will utilize generalized estimating equations to account for the repeated measures design, clustering of patients within physicians, and clustering of physicians within clinics.

      " Prevention of foot ulcer should result in a reduction in the risk of lower limb amputation. We propose to identify risk factors for diabetic foot ulcer by studying the relationship between endothelial dysfunction and foot ulcer risk. It has been proposed that impaired vasoregulation in diabetic patients leads to the development and perpetuation of chronic foot ulceration via failure of the normal hyperemic response to injury. A fundamental defect that has been demonstrated in type 1 and 2 diabetic subjects is impaired vasodilatory reserve, which reflects dysfunction of endothelium-dependent vasodilation. Our findings thus far point to an important role of the microvasculature in the development of diabetic foot ulcer and amputation, with our demonstration of higher foot ulcer and lower-limb amputation risk in relation to lower dorsal foot transcutaneous oxygen level. The role of endothelial dysfunction in relation to diabetic foot ulcer risk has not previously been studied. We will follow a well-characterized cohort of 750 diabetic veterans without foot ulcer over 3-year after obtaining baseline measures of endothelial function using iontophoretic application of acetylcholine to induce cutaneous endothelium-dependent vasodilation on the dorsal foot. Iontophoresis permits noninvasive delivery of ionic drugs cutaneously without damage to the skin or systemic effects. Change in microvascular flow will be measured using a laser Doppler imager (Moor LDI) over a 4x4 cm area divided into 18496 measurement sites. Endothelial function will be defined as the difference between readings before and after the iontophoretic application of a 1% acetylcholine solution at a current of 0.2 mA for 1 minute, with higher readings reflecting better endothelial function. These techniques are the accepted standard method for assessment of endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the cutaneous microvasculature. Additional measurements will be obtained on other ulcer risk factors to assess whether endothelial dysfunction independently influences foot ulcer risk, or whether it is merely a marker for different pathophysiologic conditions responsible for higher risk (eg., sensory neuropathy). Possible confounding factors considered will include sensory and autonomic neuropathy; dorsal foot transcutaneous oximetry; macrovascular function assessed with Doppler blood pressures; diabetes characteristics; in-shoe plantar pressure (F-scan), medication use, and foot deformity. \n",

There are two components to this study: An outcomes component to complete information previously gathered in clinical and computerized databases of 800 SCI patients and a convenience sample of age-matched able-bodied veterans and perform a follow up for cardiac events. A screening component to identify pre-clinical disease will include Holter ECG recordings and echocardiograms on patients without symptoms or evidence for heart disease seen in the SCI center during the course of the study and age-matched able-bodied veterans. Hypothesis (a): The prevalence and incidence of cardiac diseases including coronary artery disease and cardiomyopathy will be higher in the SCI population than age-matched samples of the able-bodied population while valvular disease and arrhythmia will be similar. (b): The prevalence and incidence of cardiac disease in SCI individuals will be associated with level and completeness of injury (ie, higher occurrence in those with higher lesion levels and more complete injuries.) (c) The ECG will be helpful in SCI patients in early identification and secondary prevention of both ischemic and cardiomyopathic heart disease. (d) Continuous Holter ECG recordings or echocardiograms will only be indicated for screening specific SCI patients identified by clinical and electrocardiographic features. \n",

      " There are two diseases in particular that may have serious consequences for driving and mobility due to their potentially severe impact on visual function: glaucoma and diabetic neuropathy. Both these diseases can potentially result in significant peripheral visual field loss, sometimes coupled with decreased visual acuity. We have previously demonstrated that each of these visual losses alone can have significant impact on driving and mobility performance. In this project we will develop predictive models of driving for these patients and apply our extensive expertise in training patients to use low-vision aids to improve driving mobility. A second question that will be addressed is how to best train scanning patients with hemianopic field loss due to cerebral vascular accidents. We propose to configure the prisms in a bioptic form similar to previously used for amorphic lenses in RP and for bioptic telescopes for patients in macular disease. The third problem that will be addressed is the identification of predictors of long-term success in the use of low-vision aids. \n",

      " The long-term goal of this research program is to develop methods to predict both the benefit and the satisfaction that hearing-impaired patients will derive from auditory amplification in daily life. This proposal has three primary objectives: (1) To determine the influence of extra-audiological variables, such as personality attributes and expectations, on the subjective outcomes of hearing aid fittings, (2) To establish a scientific basis for selection, administration, and interpretation of self-report measures of hearing aid fitting outcome, (3) To resolve the long-standing debate about the efficacy of using clinically measured loudness perception data in hearing aid prescriptions. \n",
      " The long-term goal of this research program is to develop methods where by clinicians can predict both the benefit and the satisfaction that individual hearing-impaired patients will derive from amplification in daily life. The present proposal continues the research directions pursued in several cycles of previous RR&D funding from 1986 to 1996. This proposal has three primary objectives: (1) To determine the influence of extra-audiological variables, such as personality attributes and expectations, on the subjective outcomes of hearing aid fittings, (2) To establish a scientific basis for selection, administration, and interpretation of self-report measures of hearing aid fitting outcome, (3) To resolve the long-standing debate about the efficacy of using clinically measured loudness perception data in hearing aid prescriptions. HYPOTHESES: 1. Inter-subject differences in personality traits, coping style, and/or expectations account for a significant and substantial amount of the variance in hearing aid fitting outcomes, independent of hearing impairment and fitting strategy. 2. Prediction of hearing aid fitting outcomes will be substantially improved if the prediction model includes extra-audiological data as well as data on impairment and hearing aid. 3. The post-fitting time course of hearing aid fitting outcome data is different for different outcome variables. 4. Self-report hearing aid fitting outcomes are stable after 3 months of hearing aid use. 5. Fitting outcomes are optimized for individuals with unpredictable loudness perception when clinically measured loudness data are used in the hearing aid fitting protocol. PROCEDURES: Investigations will explore:(1)the determinants and characteristics of subjective outcome variables, and (2) the value of individual loudness data in hearing aid fitting. Subjects will be elderly men and women with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. The work will be performed at the Memphis VAMC Hearing Aid Research Laboratory. Determinants and characteristics of subjective outcome variables. When self-reports are used to evaluate hearing aid fitting outcome, it is assumed that the data primarily reflect the efficacy of the hearing aid and the fitting strategy. There is a lack of information about the extent to which other variables might impact self-report data. We will explore this topic with 120 potential hearing aid wearers, followed from their initial expression of interest in amplification through the entire fitting process and for six months after the fitting. Data describing a range of pre-fitting variables as well as hearing impairment, and hearing aid fitting will be collected in a consortium of six clinical sites (including 5 VA sites) coordinated from the Memphis laboratory. The Memphis research team will complete data collection with each subject by collecting outcome data at three post-fitting intervals. \n",

      " The project objective is to validate the types of eye trackers that may most effectively be employed in the rehabilitation evaluation and training of people with central scotomas. The eye trackers will include equipment representing the three basic types of eye trackers, namely, 1) electrophysical (e.g., electrooculogram or EOG), 2) front surface trackers (e.g. pupil), and 3) retinal trackers (e.g. SLO). The most appropriate eye tracking system for evaluation and training will depend on the type of eye movements (i.e., fixations, saccades, and pursuits) that comprise the complex eye movements used for visual skills (e.g., spotting, localization, scanning, tracing, tracking) which are being evaluated/trained for visually guided activities of daily living (e.g., reading, face recognition and television watching). The following methods will be employed. First, a Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope (SLO) will be employed to confirm that people with central scotomas are recruited from the Atlanta VA Eye Clinic and the VA Rehab R&D Subject Registry. SLO data taken for each eye will determine scotoma density, size and position. Visual functions of acuity, contrast sensitivity, and visual fields will be measured. Basic eye movements (e.g., fixation, tracking, saccades) and complex eye movements during visual tasks will be investigated to determine the effect of different biocular scotoma/PRL characteristics including: 1) central scotoma in one eye and functioning fovea in fellow eye, 2) central scotoma in both eyes and PRLs in retinal correspondence, and 3) central scotomas in both eyes with PRLs in anomalous retinal correspondence. Based on these biocular eye movement results, specifications can be developed for determining which eye can be used to monitor eye movements during binocular visual tasks (e.g., reading, face recognition, and TV event watching) as well as the need for biocular eye tracking equipment in evaluating complex eye movements. Each person will be tested using each representative eye tracker. The results of each eye tracker (position, velocity, and acceleration) in measuring PRL movements during fixation, saccade, and pursuit will be related to SLO measures. The results of these tests will also be compared to the types of measurements needed for evaluating complex eye movements in visual tasks. Specific measurements will be used to evaluate a patient's ability to perform the basic visual skills employed in performing everyday vision-related activities. The cost effectiveness of employing each type of eye tracker will be determined by a number of factors, including equipment cost, maintenance costs, ease of calibration and ease of use with low vision patients (e.g., feasibility for use with low vision patients who use head turns or optical low vision devices to view stimuli), and long-term reliability. Feasibility studies employing an eye tracker for eye movement monitoring during evaluations or biofeedback during training will be done in a few clinical studies (perimetry, PRL ability, visual scanning for reading training, and visual scanning for faces training) to indicate the potential clinical practicality of employing eye trackers for rehabilitative evaluation and training. \n",

However, there are no precise methods for predicting which patients will improve and, for those who do, how much improvement will occur. There is a need to improve prognostic precision in aphasia. Currently employed prognostic methods miss improvement levels by substantial margins. Prognostic information could have a great economic and social impact on patients, their families, and their treatment. The purpose of this investigation is to test the precision of auditory evoked responses (AERs) to provide a prognosis for improvement in aphasia subsequent to a left hemisphere thromboembolic infarct.

Phonemic, phonologic, semantic, and syntactic language tasks will be used to elicit AERs, including the auditory late response, the mismatch negativity response (MMN), the N400, and the P600. Twenty moderately aphasic subjects, 20 severely aphasic subjects, and 20 age-matched, normal subjects will be tested. All aphasic subjects will be evaluated with the AER test battery and a language test battery: Western Aphasia Battery (WAB), Porch Index of Communicative Ability (PICA), the Token Test (TT), the Auditory Comprehension Test for Sentences (ACTS), and the ASHA Functional Assessment of Communication Skills for Adults (ASHA FACS). All tests will be repeated in 6 and 12 weeks, during which the aphasic subjects will receive treatment. Aphasic subjects will receive follow-up testing 3 and 6 months after the treatment phase is completed. The patterns of the AERs will be examined. Correlations and analyses of variance (ANOVAs) will be used to assess the relationships between AER measures and improvement in aphasia quantified by behavioral measures. A multiple regression technique will be used to determine the best predictor(s) of improvement in aphasia. Correlations and analyses of variance (ANOVAs) will be used to assess the relationship between AER measures and severity of aphasia. Correlations and assessment of composite CT/MRI reconstructions for subject groups will be used to determine the relationship between size (correlations) and site of lesion, AERs, and severity and improvement in aphasia. \n",

      " The purpose of this study is to examine and relate physiological, behavioral, and self-perceived changes after a period of hearing aid use and as a function of auditory training. The primary objective of this study is to determine how physiological changes may be related to functional changes. The design of this experiment also will allow for evaluation of training effects, in particular, whether training enhances physiological change and further whether specific training transfers functionally and physiologically to similar stimuli. The proposed project will focus on the following questions: 1) Is an experience-related behavioral change in hearing aid performance over time reflected as a neurophysiologic change in the central auditory system? 2) Does a neurophysiologic change occur prior to or in conjunction with an experience-related behavioral change in hearing aid performance over time? 3) Does behavioral training over an extended period of time modify the neurophysiologic representation of speech following the provision of hearing aids? 4) What is the relationship between physiologic, behavioral, and self-perceived change over time and is this relationship impacted by behavioral training? 5) Are neurophysiologic changes in acoustic representations at a pre-attentive level limited to trained stimuli or does auditory training following the provision of hearing aids alter neurophysiological responses to novel speech sounds with acoustic content similar to the trained stimuli? Forty-eight hearing-impaired adults between the ages of 18 and 60 with no hearing aid experience will serve as subjects. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two experimental groups: a. individuals who receive auditory exposure in the real-world only; b. individuals who receive intense, controlled auditory practice with feedback, in addition to auditory exposure in the real world. Dependent variables will include measures of behavioral function (frequency specific speech recognition and confidence in different levels of noise), physiological function (amplitude and latency of mismatch negativity), and self-perception (Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit) over time. Data will be analyzed to evaluate relative change over time for each dependent variable and also to examine the relationship between the dependent variables considering hours of hearing aid use and audibility as potential covariates. \n",

      " Because of its close association with sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus is a prevalent issue for veterans who are proportionally more hearing-impaired than the civilian population. The VA system disburses $110 million per year to over 115,000 veterans for their service-connected tinnitus disability, thus it is clearly a problem for veterans and for the VA. Unfortunately, most VAMCs do not have systematic clinical care available for their veterans suffering from tinnitus. The most obvious needs are to develop effective treatment methodologies for veterans, and to standardize a procedure for quantifying the disorder. Each of these concerns is a focus of this laboratory, and the present proposal addresses the latter need as a continuation study to develop reliable techniques to measure tinnitus. The goal of this proposed study is a fully functional system, documented for response reliability and ready for clinical implementation at VA audiology clinics outside of Portland. To achieve that end goal, the study will be conducted as three concurrent projects: (1) Further laboratory development of the automated technique for comprehensive tinnitus quantification; (2) Development of a technique to test for tinnitus \"malingering\"; and (3) Evaluation of the automated technique in the clinical environment. For Project 1, a series of experiments is proposed to reduce the time of testing, and to add new measurement capabilities. Each experiment will involve specification, design, and implementation of program modifications, human subject testing, analysis of results, and further modifications as indicated. Another series of experiments (Project 2) will be conducted to develop a tinnitus malingering exam. With such a test, veterans with true tinnitus would provide reliable responses, while those feigning tinnitus would have difficulty responding reliably. For Project 3, a duplicate measurement system will be installed at the Portland VA Regional Tinnitus Clinic. The automated technique will be used to quantify tinnitus in veteran patients during their tinnitus evaluation. Patients will be invited to return for repeat testing, which will provide reliability data for clinical responses. This project will promote clinical feedback that will be important for final development of the system as a clinical tool. The three projects outlined above are designed to develop an efficient clinical technique to quantify tinnitus perception. Because the technique is computer automated, its implementation at VA clinics will involve a minimum of training and expenditure. The technique is further expected to impact the medical care of non-VA clinics, and could \n",

      " For people who have become hemiplegic as a result of a stroke, a critical safety-related retraining area for physical functions is wheelchair transfers. In addition, to incorporate the relatively unsupervised home care into the rehabilitation process, clinicians require a better means to assess functional gains and provide effective training tools. Our goal is to develop a personalized training and clinical assessment instrument based on the Video-Based F-PAT (Functional Performance Assessment and Training) which relies on the manipulation of digitized videoclips. Our development objectives are (1) to enhance the pilot F-PAT web site to allow clinicians password-protected access to the digitized video and assessment information; and (2) to train an Occupational Therapist collaborator to create the personalized videotapes for patients to take home with them. Our clinical objective is to implement a 2-year evaluation of the F-PAT design concept with 30 subjects, divided in 3 groups, who as patients undergo acute rehabilitation at the VA Comprehensive Rehabilitation Center and are discharged to their homes or a sub-acute facility. This study has the dual goal of evaluating the effectiveness of the personalized training videotapes and the effectiveness of the video-based assessment methodology. The study will divide the subjects into three treatment groups to compare the effectiveness of accepted practice, generic videotape, and personalized videotape home-based instruction for clients and care providers. Comparison of outcomes will be done using videotape of task performance before release from the acute therapy program and at the follow-up evaluation one month later. The subjects will be evaluated by a blinded physiatrist viewing and rating digitized videoclips of task performance on the F-PAT web site. This study will determine if personalized videoclip-based instructional material is effective, and if videoclip comparisons by a clinician is an effective diagnosis and assessment instrument. If it is not possible for logistical reasons for a subject to return to the clinic for the follow-on evaluation, the F-PAT team will visit the subject's home and perform the videotaping on-site. The remainder of the evaluation with input from the physiatrist will occur subsequently at the clinic. \n",

      " The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of 3 anti-HIV combination treatments that do not use protease inhibitors (PIs). The current rule for starting treatment of HIV infection is to combine members from different classes of anti-HIV drugs, such as 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and either a PI or a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). However, these combinations can be complicated and difficult to take, can cause a number of side effects, and may become ineffective. Combinations that are simpler, better tolerated, and more effective are needed. Because PIs can cause long-term side effects and because HIV can become resistant to many of them at the same time, anti-HIV combination treatments that do not use PIs are being tested. \n",
      " Current treatment guidelines recommend combination regimens of 2 nucleoside analogues with either a PI or an NNRTI for the initial treatment of HIV infection. However, the efficacy of current regimens is limited by their complexity, pharmacokinetic characteristics, short- and long-term side effects, and drug-resistance profiles at the time of virologic failure. Consequently, the identification of new initial regimens that are simpler, better tolerated, preserve treatment options in the event of failure, and improve antiretroviral potency is needed. In addition, recent concern over the long-term toxicities of PIs and the extensive cross-resistance among the available PIs have led to the testing of PI-sparing regimens. Participants will be in this study for a minimum of 120 weeks and a maximum of approximately 4 years. In Step 1, patients are randomly selected to receive 1 of 3 blinded treatment regimens: abacavir (ABC)/lamivudine (3TC)/zidovudine (ZDV)/efavirenz (EFV), ABC/3TC/ZDV, or 3TC/ZDV/EFV. Patients with confirmed virologic failure on Step 1 and two successive plasma HIV RNA levels of 10,000 copies/ml or greater must register to Step 2. Patients with confirmed virologic failure on Step 1 and whose plasma HIV RNA is under 10,000 copies/ml may remain on Step 1 or register to Step 2. [AS PER AMENDMENT 04/11/03: Discontinuation of Arm B was recommended. Consequently, Arms A and C were unblinded to EFV but not to ABC. A number of options are available for patients originally randomized to Arm B.] Step 2 is open label. Regimens include 2 or 3 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in combination with EFV, atazanavir (ATZ), ritonavir-boosted ATZ, or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). Patients on Arm B treatment who have an HIV RNA level less than 200 copies/ml within the past 8 weeks are eligible for randomization to open-label intensification of Arm B on Step 3. Step 3 regimens include ABC/3TC/ZDV plus either EFV or TDF. Patients with evidence of treatment-limiting toxicity to Step 3 study drugs have the option of substituting d4T for ZDV, ddI for ABC or TDF, and/or NVP for EFV. Patients with confirmed virologic failure on Step 3 and whose plasma HIV RNA is less than 10,000 copies/ml may either remain on Step 3 or register to Step 4. Patients with two successive plasma HIV RNA levels of 10,000 copies/ml or greater on Step 3 must register to Step 4. Step 4 is open label. Regimens include two or three NRTIs plus EFV, ATV, ritonavir-boosted ATV, or TDF. Clinical assessments and laboratory evaluations are done at entry, at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and then every 8 weeks thereafter for the duration of the study. Evaluations are also required when a protocol-allowed drug substitution is made. In addition, 3 substudies are being conducted: a neurology substudy for efavirenz, a pharmacology substudy for atazanavir, and a viral dynamics substudy. \n",

      "Title = Hormone Replacement Therapy to Treat Turner Syndrome.\n",
      " This study will evaluate the effects of hormone replacement therapy on patients with Turner syndrome (TS)-a genetic disorder in females in which part or all of one X chromosome is missing. Most girls and women with TS have underdeveloped ovaries-the female reproductive organs that produce the female sex hormones estrogen and progesterone, and smaller amounts of the male sex hormone, testosterone. These hormones affect muscle and bone strength, sex drive, energy, and an overall sense of well being. Estrogen may also play a role in memory and mood and have a protective effect against heart disease. Women with TS have a much higher risk of developing osteoporosis (loss of bone density), high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes than women without this disorder. Girls and women with Turner syndrome between the ages of 14 and 50 years may be eligible for this 2-year study. Three months before beginning treatment, all patients will wear an estrogen patch and take a progesterone tablet daily for 10 days each month. They will then be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups to compare the effects of estrogen alone with estrogen plus testosterone on bone strength, muscle and fat mass and psychosocial well being. Both groups will wear an estrogen patch and take oral progesterone. One group will also wear a testosterone patch while the other group will wear a placebo patch (a patch that does not contain any testosterone). Neither study participants nor the doctors will know who is getting the testosterone until the study is complete. Patients will undergo the following procedures before beginning treatment and at 6, 12 and 24 months after starting treatment: - Physical examination. - DEXA scans (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) to measure body composition and bone thickness. Low radiation X-rays scan the whole body to measure fat, muscle and bone mineral content.. - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the abdomen to measure the amount of fat around the internal organs. The patient lies on a stretcher in a large tube surrounded by a magnetic field during the scanning. The procedure uses a strong magnet and radio waves to produce the images. - Heel ultrasound to measure bone thickness. The heel is placed in a chamber and sound waves pass through it to produce images. - Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) for diabetes and problems with carbohydrate metabolism. The patient drinks a sugary substance. A small amount of blood is drawn before taking the drink and four times afterwards. - Blood and urine tests to measure blood counts, liver and kidney function, ovarian hormones, growth factors, thyroid function, blood lipids, bone strength markers, and to test for pregnancy. - Blood pressure measurements. - Psychological testing for the effect of treatment on mood, self-esteem, quality of life, social shyness, anxiety and sexual function. - Neurocognitive tests (at first inpatient visit and 1 and 2 years after starting treatment) to measure nonverbal memory and visual-perceptual abilities. During the hospital admissions, patients will be given a \"metabolic diet\" that contains specific amounts of salt and carbohydrates to ensure accurate blood pressure and sugar metabolism measurements. Patients will keep a record of their menstrual periods and physical activity throughout the treatment period. \n",
      " Turner Syndrome (TS) is characterized by ovarian dysgenesis and short stature resulting from the partial or complete deletion of one X-chromosome. Adults with TS have excessive rates of osteoporosis, hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes mellitus and may have increased morbidity and mortality as a result. These problems of adults with TS may be secondary to deficiency of ovarian hormones or may result from halpo-insufficiency for as yet unknown X-chromosome genes. There have been no prospective, controlled studies of the effects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in TS, but available data suggest that conventional oral HRT designed for postmenopausal women may not prevent osteoporosis and may aggravate hypertension in this disorder. Of note, girls and women with TS are deficient in ovarian androgens as well as estrogen, and have reduced muscle mass, which may contribute to osteoporosis and insulin resistance. In addition, reduced androgens may contribute to the impairment of self esteem and social interactions suffered by many with TS. In this study, two different hormone regimens for TS will be compared in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind design. Both groups will receive transdermal estradiol (E2, 100 mcg/day) with cyclic progesterone; one group will receive a physiological dose of testosterone (T) by transdermal patch while the other group will receive a placebo patch. The treatment duration is 2 years. Major outcome parameters include predicted improvements in bone mineral density, body composition and psychosocial well-being. Essential information will be collected on the effects of hormone treatments on insulin sensitivity and blood pressure in TS. This study will help to optimize hormone replacement treatment for women with TS, and to clarify which of the metabolic problems of TS are secondary to ovarian hormone deficiency, and which are due to genetic factors. \n",

      "Title = Natural History Study of Smith-Magenis Syndrome.\n",
      " This study will examine how a rare disease called Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) affects people and how they change over time. SMS is caused by a small chromosome 17p11.2 deletion (missing piece). The syndrome is associated with distinct physical, developmental and behavioral characteristics, but it is not fully understood. To learn more about this disease, a multidisciplinary research team will study: - The range and type of medical, behavioral, and learning problems of people with SMS - The deletion of chromosome 17p11.2 to find the gene or genes that cause SMS - Whether certain specific genetic changes cause certain specific medical problems - What signs and symptoms must be present to make a diagnosis of SMS - The impact that a child with SMS has on his or her family members. Patients of all ages with SMS may be eligible for this study. They will be evaluated by a team of medical specialists at the NIH Clinical Center over the course of several days. Parents of patients will be asked to provide copies of past medical records and tests results for review. They will provide a family medical history and information on the child s prenatal, developmental, behavioral and medical histories. The study may involve the following evaluations: physical, neurological and psychological exams; ear, nose and throat evaluation; speech, language and swallowing evaluation; hearing test; eye examination; imaging studies (e.g., X-rays, ultrasound, MRI); developmental and behavioral assessment; rehabilitation evaluation with gait (walking) analysis; urinalysis, blood, and/or skin cell studies; sleep study; other consultations as required. A tissue sample (blood or cheek swab or skin biopsy) may be taken for genetic studies. To obtain a cheek swab, a small brush is rubbed against the inside of the cheek to wipe off some cells. For a skin biopsy, a small area of skin is numbed with a local anesthetic and a small circle of skin, usually about 1/8 inch, is removed with a biopsy tool. Parents may be asked to complete questionnaires about their child s growth and development, therapies, medications, sleep, development and behavioral concerns. They also may be asked to bring their child to NIH for follow-up visits every 6 months to 3 years, depending on the child s age. The purpose of these visits is to see how the child changes over time and to conduct additional tests. Parents may also be asked to enroll their child in a SMS Research Registry and provide tissue samples for a SMS Research Core Tissue Bank. The research registry is a confidential database of individuals diagnosed with SMS. Its purpose is to facilitate SMS research initiatives and promote the development of improved treatments for SMS. Enrollment requires completing a 30-minute questionnaire. The tissue bank stores tissue cultures and cell lines created for future SMS research. About 2 teaspoons of blood are drawn from adult patients and 1 to 3 teaspoons from children, depending on their size. Tissue samples can be obtained by skin biopsy or during a scheduled surgical procedure. \n",
      " This project investigates the clinical manifestations and molecular genetic defects of Smith-Magenis Syndrome (SMS), a rare (1/15,000 1/25,000) clinically recognizable yet often under diagnosed multiple congenital anomaly/intellectual disability (MCA/ID) syndrome (OMIM #182290). The syndrome is characterized by a distinct pattern of minor craniofacial and skeletal anomalies, expressive speech/language delays, psychomotor and growth retardation, and a striking neurobehavioral phenotype that includes a circadian sleep disorder. The majority of cases (~90%) are due to de novo interstitial deletion of chromosome 17p11.2 that includes the RAI1 (retinoic acid induced 1) gene; however, heterozygous RAI1 mutations account for about 10% of cases. While clinical variability exists, haploinsufficiency of RAI1 (by deletion or mutation) is believed to be responsible for most of the common features that characterize the syndrome. Individuals with confirmed or clinically suspected SMS, their parents, and/or unaffected siblings will be enrolled in this comprehensive longitudinal natural history study. An NIH interdisciplinary SMS Research Team (SMS-RT) of clinical and basic science researchers, in collaboration with extramural investigators, will conduct comprehensive clinical and molecular analyses to delineate the physiological, developmental (cognitive), behavioral, biochemical, and cellular processes that characterize the syndrome. The protocol aims to: characterize the phenotypic variability, natural history and underlying pathophysiology of SMS; delineate the neurobehavioral phenotype with respect to sleep disturbance, cognition, mood and maladaptive behaviors and sensory processing dysfunction; investigate the physiologic and functional aspects specifically underlying delays in speech/language and motor development; explore genotype/phenotype correlations to identify gene(s) or modifiers that contribute to phenotypic variability; determine potential intervention and therapeutic strategies likely to improve outcome; and evaluate the psychosocial impact of SMS on the family system. Offsite enrollment of two pediatric comparison groups to participate in the Home Assessment of Sleep (HAS) are also enrolled: 1) unaffected siblings/control group; and 2) a DD/ID-comparison group of children with developmental/intellectual disabilities associated with sleep disturbances. \n",

      "Title = Safety and Effectiveness of the Selegiline \"Patch\" for Decreased Mental Function in HIV Patients.\n",
      " A decrease in mental function often occurs in patients with HIV. Antiretroviral (ARV) drugs are used to treat this but are not entirely effective. Some other therapy could play a role. The drug selegiline in its pill form is used to treat Parkinson's disease, a serious brain disorder. It is believed this drug might protect the brain and repair some damage. This study will use this drug in a \"patch\" form, which has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to see if it helps with decreased mental function in patients with HIV. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of selegiline transdermal system (STS) in the treatment of decreased mental function in patients with HIV. \n",
      " Cognitive impairment is a common adverse effect of HIV infection that can progress to dementia. ARVs are the only current therapy, but treatment response is frequently unsatisfactory, short lived, or the agents are poorly tolerated in doses adequate for central nervous system (CNS) penetration. An adjunctive therapy that interferes with the cascade of events triggered by the virus is likely to play an important role. Oral selegiline is an approved and marketed drug for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease. Studies suggest that selegiline has a neuroprotective effect and that it may exert a \"rescue effect\" on dying and injured neurons. This study proposes to use transdermal selegiline, which may deliver a greater dose level than oral administration, in the treatment of HIV-associated cognitive impairment. This is a two-step study, with each step lasting 24 weeks. Step 1 is double-blind and Step 2 is open label. At entry, patients are randomly assigned to receive either the STS or placebo. One STS patch will be applied daily at the same time for 24 weeks. Patients are evaluated at the clinic at entry and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24. Cognitive status will be evaluated by performance on a series of neuropsychological assessments. Patients who complete Step 1 may participate in Step 2. Patients on placebo in Step 1 will receive active STS treatment in Step 2. The STS patch is applied once daily for an additional 24 weeks and patients are evaluated at the clinic at Weeks 28, 36, and 48. \n",

      "Title = Treatment of Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis With Pioglitazone.\n",
      " This study will evaluate the effectiveness of pioglitazone, a new diabetes medicine, on decreasing insulin resistance and improving liver disease in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH is a chronic liver disease with unknown cause that involves fat accumulation and inflammation in the liver, leading to liver cirrhosis in 10 to 15 percent of patients and significant liver scarring in another 30 percent. Although similar to a condition that affects people who drink excessive amounts of alcohol, NASH occurs in people who drink only minimal or no alcohol. It is most often seen in patients with insulin resistance. Pioglitazone decreases insulin resistance and improves blood lipid (fat) levels, so that it may improve liver disease in NASH. Patients with NASH 18 years of age or older may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history and physical examination and routine blood tests. They will see a dietitian for counseling on diet and weight reduction, if needed. They will stop taking any medications for liver disease and take a daily multivitamin pill. After 2 months, those eligible for participation will be enrolled in the study. Participants will be admitted to the Clinical Center for 2 to 3 days for a complete medical history, physical examination, blood tests, urinalysis, chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, abdominal ultrasound and a liver biopsy. After the diagnosis of NASH is confirmed, the following procedures will be performed: - Echocardiography - imaging test using sound waves shows the heart structure and function - Resting metabolic rate - measures amount of oxygen (and calories) used to maintain body functions at rest. While lying down, the patient wears a clear plastic hood over the head for 20 minutes while the amount of oxygen used is measured. - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans - shows the size of the liver and other organs. The patient lies on a table in a metal cylinder that contains a magnetic field (the scanner) for no more than 30 minutes while the organs are imaged. - Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan measures whole body composition, including amount of fat. The patient lies under an X-ray scanning machine for about 2 minutes. - Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) - measures blood sugar and insulin levels. The patient drinks a very sweet drink containing glucose (sugar), after which blood samples are collected at various intervals during the 3-hour test. The blood is drawn through a catheter (thin plastic tube) placed in the arm before the test begins. - Intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) - determines how the tissues respond to insulin and glucose. Glucose is injected into a vein, followed by a short infusion of insulin. Blood samples are collected through a catheter at various intervals during the 3-hour test. When the above procedures are completed, patients start taking pioglitazone by mouth once a day for 48 weeks, keeping track of the medication and any side effects. They will be seen at the clinic every 2 weeks for the first month and then every 4 weeks for the rest of the treatment period. The visits will include an interview and examination by a physician and blood draw for laboratory tests. Female patients will have a pregnancy test at each clinic visit. At the end of the treatment period patients will be admitted to the Clinical Center for a repeat medical evaluation that will include the procedures described above. \n",
      " Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a clinicopathological entity that is being recognized more frequently in recent years. It is characterized by histologic changes that are similar to alcoholic hepatitis, but in the absence of excessive alcohol consumption. It is typically associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity and dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. It may progress and cause severe hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis in significant numbers of patients. Currently, there is no effective therapy for this condition. In this pilot, open label study, we propose to treat 30 patients with nonalcoholic hepatitis with pioglitazone for 48 weeks. Pioglitazone has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity, the possible underlying mechanism of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Pioglitazone is an antidiabetic drug that belongs to thiazolidinedione group. The mechanism of action is thought to be mediated by activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors-gamma (PPAR-gamma). After an initial evaluation of insulin sensitivity, fat distribution and liver biopsy, patients will receive 30 mg of pioglitazone, orally for 48 weeks. Patients will be monitored at regular intervals for symptoms of liver disease, side effects of pioglitazone, serum biochemical and metabolic indices. At 48 weeks, patients will have a repeat medical evaluation and liver biopsy. Pre and post treatment liver histology, fat distribution and insulin sensitivity will be compared. The primary end point of successful therapy will be improvement in hepatic histology as determined by reduction of at least three points in NASH activity score. Secondary end points will be improvement in insulin sensitivity, reduction in visceral fat, liver volume and liver biochemistry. \n",

      "Title = Interleukin-2 Plus Antiretroviral Therapy for HIV-Infected Patients With Low CD4+ Counts (SILCAAT Study).\n",
      " This study will examine whether interleukin-2 (IL-2) plus antiretroviral therapy (ART) slows HIV disease progression in patients with low CD4+ T cell counts compared with patients taking ART alone. CD4+ T cells are a subset of lymphocytes-white blood cells that are part of the body's immune system. IL-2 is a protein that is naturally produced by lymphocytes. Given in intermittent cycles, IL-2 can raise CD4+ T cell counts in some HIV-infected patients taking antiretroviral drugs. This study will examine whether the increase in CD4+ T cells lowers the risk of AIDS-related illnesses and death. HIV-infected patients 18 years of age and older with a viral load under 10,000 copies per milliliter and a CD4+ T cell count between 50 and 299 cells per cubic millimeter who are taking antiretroviral therapy and who have not previously received IL-2 therapy may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, and blood and urine tests. Participation in the study will be from 4.5 to 6 years, depending on what point in the duration of the study the individual patient is enrolled. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive IL-2 plus ART or ART alone. All participants will be advised individually about the best ART regimen for them. Patients in the IL-2 treatment group will be taught how to self-inject IL-2 under the skin (similar to insulin injections). They will inject IL-2 twice a day for 5 days every 8 weeks for the first year (until week 49 of the study). From week 49 on they may receive 5-day cycles of IL-2 every 4 months when needed to maintain CD4+ T cell count elevations. An extra cycle may be given 2 months after the week 49 follow-up visit (see follow-up schedule below), depending on their CD4+ T cell count. Patients whose cell counts have not increased after 12 to 16 months of IL-2 treatment will discuss with the doctor the possibility of stopping IL-2. Those who do stop IL-2 treatment will be asked to remain in the study for follow-up evaluations. All patients will be followed in the clinic every 2 months for the first year of the study (weeks 1, 9, 17, 25, 33, 41 and 49) and every 4 months during years 2-6 for a brief history and physical exam, urine and blood tests, return of diary cards (record of drug side effects) and medication review. During the visits from the second year on, patients will also be asked about their ability to do certain ordinary tasks, such as taking care of themselves; ... \n",
      " The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical results of individuals living with advanced HIV infection who are treated with interleukin-2 (IL-2) plus active antiretroviral therapy (ART) to a control group of individuals treated with stable ART alone. The primary objective of the study is to determine if intermittent cycles of IL-2 delay the occurrence of opportunistic infections and the progression of advanced HIV disease compared to ART alone. Patients will be assigned randomly to 1 of 2 groups. Patients in Group 1 will receive subcutaneous IL-2 twice a day for 5 days, every 8 weeks, in addition to ART. Patients in Group 2 will receive ART only. In both groups, CD4+ T cell counts and viral load are monitored. \n",

      "Title = Riluzole to Treat Parkinson's Disease.\n",
      " This study will evaluate the effects of the drug riluzole on Parkinson's disease symptoms and on dyskinesias (involuntary movements) that develop as a result of long-term treatment with levodopa. Riluzole blocks the action of the chemical messenger glutamate, thought to be involved in producing Parkinson's symptoms. The drug is currently approved to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, another neurologic condition. Patients with relatively advanced Parkinson's disease between 20 and 80 years of age may be eligible for this 4-week study. Participants will have a complete medical history and physical examination, and a detailed neurological evaluation. The evaluations will include blood tests and an electrocardiogram, and possibly brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), CT scan, and chest X-ray. Participants will, if possible, stop taking all antiparkinsonian medications except levodopa (Sinemet) for one month before the study begins and throughout its duration. For the first 1 to 3 days, patients will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center to undergo a levodopa \"dose-finding\" procedure. For this study, patients will stop taking their oral Sinemet and instead will have levodopa infused through a vein for up to 8 hours/day. During the infusions, the levodopa dose will be increased slowly until either 1) parkinsonian symptoms improve, 2) unacceptable side effects occur, or 3) the maximum study dose is reached. Symptoms will be monitored frequently to find two infusion rates: 1) one that is less than what is needed to relieve symptoms (suboptimal rate), and 2) one that relieves symptoms but may produce dyskinesias (optimal rate). When the dose-finding phase is completed, treatment will begin. Patients will take riluzole or placebo (a look-a-like pill with no active ingredient) twice a day, along with their regular Sinemet, for 3 weeks. (All participants will receive placebo at some time during the study, and some patients will receive only placebo throughout the entire 4 weeks.) At the end of each week, patients will be readmitted to the hospital and receive the previous week's dose of riluzole or placebo in combination with a levodopa infusion at the rate determined in the dose-finding phase of the study. The procedure for the infusion will be the same as that for the dose-finding phase. The dose of riluzole will be increased until the optimum dose has been achieved or until side effects occur (at which time the dose will be lowered or the drug stopped). Throughout the study, parkinsonian symptoms and dyskinesias will be evaluated using standardized rating scales and blood samples will be drawn periodically to measure drug levels. \n",
      " The objective of this study is to evaluate the acute effects of a nonselective inhibitor of glutamate mediated synaptic transmission on the severity of parkinsonian signs and levodopa-associated motor response complications in patients with moderately advanced Parkinson's disease. In a controlled proof-of-principle clinical trial, the efficacy of the glutamate release inhibitor riluzole will be assessed through the use of validated motor function scales. Safety will be monitored by means of frequent clinical evaluations and laboratory tests. \n",

      " The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of the drug cyclophosphamide (CY) on inflammation and immune responses in individuals with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Inflammation and immunologic response appear to contribute to neurodegeneration in people with AD. In a process called gliosis, the brain immune cells microglia and astroglia undergo activation and possible proliferation, which promotes neuronal injury and death. Activated microglia and astroglia produce compounds that are cytotoxic to neurons, and they express molecules that greatly amplify immune and inflammatory processes in the brain. Excessive glial activation and proliferation are thought to be pivotal events that hasten the demise of synapses and neurons in AD. Fortunately, increased understanding of immune and inflammatory pathology in AD has provided new opportunities for designing disease-altering treatments for AD. Studies suggest that medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and immunomodulatory agents may have an important role in altering the course of AD. CY is a potent anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory drug that inhibits proliferation of immune cells. This study will evaluate the effects of CY on individuals with mild to moderate AD. Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive either two different doses of CY or placebo (an inactive pill) for 6 months. Participants who receive placebo during the 6 months will have the option of receiving CY for an additional 6 months. Participants will undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain. Measures of cerebral spinal fluid biomarkers or neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, and neuroimmune activation will be taken. In addition, peripheral lymphocyte subsets and peripheral markers of inflammation will be assessed. \n",
      " Objectives. The protocol is focused on the immune and inflammatory reactions in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the possibility that blocking the inflammatory response may alter the course of the illness. The specific plan is to evaluate the biologic and clinical effects of two doses of cyclophosphamide (CY) immunotherapy in AD patients compared to the clinically available cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor (COX-2), rofecoxib. The study will test the hypotheses that CY: 1) Is safe and tolerable in AD patients in meaningful clinical doses, 2) Can modify central nervous system inflammation and immune responses in AD, 3) Inhibits neurodegeneration in AD brains as indicated by peripheral biomarkers of AD pathology, and 4) Is different quantitatively or qualitatively in its effect on immune markers than placebo or other clinically-available anti-inflammatory drugs such as the COX-2 inhibitor, rofecoxib. Rationale. Inflammation and immunologic responses appear to contribute significantly to neurodegeneration in (AD). In a pathological process termed gliosis, the brain's resident immune cells (microglia and astroglia) undergo chronic activation and possible proliferation, promoting neuronal injury and death by several means. Activated microglia and astroglia produce compounds that are directly cytotoxic to neurons, and they express molecules that greatly amplify immune and inflammatory processes in the brain. Excessive glial activation and proliferation are thought to be pivotal events hastening the demise of synapses and neurons in AD. Conversely, the growing understanding of immune and inflammatory pathology in AD has provided new opportunities for designing disease-altering treatments for AD. Preliminary clinical trials of anti-inflammatory drugs in AD patients, epidemiologic studies of anti-inflammatory drug use, and experimental models linking neurodegeneration with neuroimmune/neuroinflammatory processes suggest strongly that medications such as nonsteroidal-anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and immunomodulatory agents may have an important role in altering the course of AD. CY is a potent anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory drug that acts primarily by inhibiting proliferation of immune cells. Moreover, as immune cell proliferation appears to be an important aspect of AD pathophysiology and disease progression, an exploratory, dose-finding trial of a cytotoxic/cytostatic drug such as CY is appropriate, especially since CY is already widely used for the treatment of other immune-mediated illnesses. Furthermore, a preliminary European trial of CY in AD patients has already demonstrated an improvement in cognitive function that correlated highly with the degree of immunomodulation achieved. Design. Study subjects will include 60 male and female patients with mild-moderate AD. In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, two doses of CY or rofecoxib will be compared over a 6-month period. While the primary outcome measures will be safety and immunologic data, cognitive and other behavioral measures will also be collected. The biological outcome measures will include measures of brain volume (assessed by magnetic resonance imaging) and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, and neuroimmune activation. In addition, peripheral lymphocyte subsets and peripheral markers of inflammation will be assessed. This design is meant to provide dose-finding data to help design a more definitive efficacy trial with CY if the safety/tolerability parameters are acceptable in this pilot study. \n",

      " Step I: In addition to continuing HAART, patients are randomized into 1 of the following 4 arms: A: Immunization placebo; B: Immunization with the canarypox HIV-vaccine (vCP1452); C: Daily low-dose IL-2 + immunization placebo; or D: Daily low-dose IL-2 + canarypox HIV-vaccine (vCP1452). Patients on Arms A, B, C, and D receive vaccine (or vaccine placebo) injections at Weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12. Patients on Arms C and D receive IL-2 by self-injection. HAART is not provided as part of this study. Step II: Patients on all arms (A, B, C, and D) who meet inclusion criteria advance to Step II and interrupt HAART for a minimum of 12 weeks. The efficacy of these immunological therapies will be determined by monitoring the dynamics of viral rebound upon cessation of antiviral therapy. After 12 weeks of Step II, patients whose viral load remains below 30,000 copies/ml remain on Step II, off HAART, and continue weekly viral load monitoring. Patients will not terminate Step II or resume HAART unless and until their viral load increases to more than 30,000 copies/ml on 3 successive determinations, or their CD4 count decreases to less than 200 cells/mm3 or less than 50 percent of the baseline CD4+ T cell concentration on 2 successive occasions. \n",

      "Title = Pyrimethamine and Sulfadoxine for Treatment of Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome.\n",
      " This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of an antibiotic called Fansidar on autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS). Patients with ALPS have enlarged lymph glands, spleen and/or liver, abnormal blood cell counts and overactive immune function. Current treatments are aimed at suppressing the immune system and improving symptoms, such as anemia (low red blood cell count) and low white blood cell and platelet counts. These treatments, however, are only partially effective and may have complications. Fansidar is a combination of two drugs, sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine, that is used to treat or prevent parasitic infections such as malaria. Recently a child with ALPS who was treated with Fansidar for a different illness had a marked shrinkage of the lymph organs. This study will examine whether Fansidar can shrink the lymph glands or spleen in patients with ALPS. Patients with ALPS between the ages of 4 and 70 years who have had lymph gland enlargement for at least 1 year and are not allergic to sulfa drugs may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history and physical examination and blood tests. Females of reproductive age will have a urine pregnancy test. Participants will be evaluated at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD, with blood tests and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the lymph nodes. For the CT scan, the patient lies on a table during an X-ray scan of the neck, part of the chest, and, if the spleen has not been removed, the stomach area. When these baseline tests are completed, patients will be given Fansidar pills to take once a week for 12 weeks. The dosage will be increased after 2 weeks and again after 4 weeks. At 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks after starting the treatment and 2 weeks after the last dose, patients will have blood drawn to check for possible side effects of therapy. Women will have a repeat urine pregnancy test at week 6 of treatment. Within a week before completing treatment or after completing treatment, patients will return to NIH for a history, physical examination, blood tests and CT scan. Patients who responded well to treatment will be offered to return to NIH again 3, 6 and 12 months later to repeat the evaluations. If ALPS symptoms recur during this time, patients will be offered another 12-week course of Fansidar and the procedure, including the 3, 6 and 12-month evaluations will be repeated again. If symptoms recur again, patients will be asked to resume Fansidar for 6 months or longer, with doses adjusted as needed. During this time, patients will be seen at NIH every 12 weeks for evaluation and blood will be drawn by the patient's private physician every 6 weeks or 2 and 4 weeks after the dose is increased to check for side effects. \n",
      " The Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome is an inherited disease associated with a defect of lymphocyte apoptosis, lymphoproliferation and autoimmunity. Although, there are treatments for many of its autoimmune complications, there currently is no safe and effective therapy for this syndrome itself. Recently investigators in Europe serendipitously found that a child with ALPS type I had significant clinical improvement while on pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine (Fansidar) for Pneumocystis carinii prophylaxis. Based on this finding, we propose to conduct a pilot study to obtain information on safety and initial data on efficacy of the drug combination Fansidar for the treatment of ALPS. Six to 8 individuals, with ALPS who report no allergy to sulfa drugs will be treated for up to 3 months with weekly Fansidar at escalating doses adjusted by weight. The effect of Fansidar treatment on lymph node and/or spleen size will be assessed by CT scanning. The effect of treatment on other laboratory features of ALPS will also be assessed. Evaluating the effects of Fansidar on these clinical and laboratory parameters will allow us to determine if this drug demonstrates sufficient activity to warrant further study in a larger randomized controlled trial. \n",

      " This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of adding the experimental drug adefovir dipivoxil to lamivudine for treating hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in HIV-infected patients with liver cirrhosis. Adefovir inhibits HBV by interfering with replication of the virus's genetic material. In some people, the drug has been active against strains of HBV that are resistant to lamivudine; it may also have some activity against HIV. HIV-infected patients 21 years of age and older with chronic hepatitis B infection and liver cirrhosis who have received lamivudine treatment for at least 1 year may be eligible for this 48-week study. Candidates will be screened with a complete medical history, blood tests and a 24-hour urine collection. Blood tests include HLA typing (a test of genetic markers on white blood cells that permit specialized immunology studies). Within 4 weeks, candidates who appear eligible for the study will have a physical examination and medical history, an abdominal ultrasound (imaging test using sound waves) to check for cancer of the liver, chest X-ray and electrocardiogram (EKG). Blood and urine tests will also be done, and women who can become pregnant will have a pregnancy test. Patients who meet the study criteria and decide to participate will then start treatment with one 10-mg adefovir pill per day by mouth. In addition, patients will continue to take all other medications prescribed by their doctor. Follow-up clinic visits will be scheduled as follows: - Days 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 21 - Blood will be drawn for specialized immunology tests and to measure blood levels of HIV and HBV. - Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44 - Blood and urine (single sample) tests will be done to determine the side effects of adefovir and its effect on the HBV infection. - Week 48 or early termination (end of study) - Blood tests (including tests for hepatitis C and D), abdominal ultrasound and a 24-hour urine collection to evaluate kidney function will be done. - Monthly visits beyond week 48 - Based on the HBV response to treatment and the availability of the drug from the sponsor, patients may be offered to extend their treatment with adefovir. Those who continue will have monthly follow-up visits for blood and urine (single sample) tests. \n",
      " Patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) who have advanced liver disease (decompensated cirrhosis by Child-Pugh score and no known cause of hepatitis other than HBV), a HBV viral load of at least 1 million copies/mL blood, and at least one year of therapy with lamivudine will be treated with open-label adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg daily and lamivudine 150 mg bid to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this regimen in this patient group and to obtain specimens for studies of immune responses to HBV in HIV-infected patients. Additionally the kinetics of viral load response to adefovir will be assessed. Specimens will be stored for possible use in evaluating HBV and HIV resistance to adefovir. L-carnitine supplementation will be used only if low serum carnitine levels are documented. Patients will be followed for HBV viral load response to adefovir for 48 weeks with possible extension. The primary study endpoints will be HBV viral load at week 24 (per-protocol patients) and DAVG at week 24 (intent-to-treat patients). Adefovir will be discontinued for toxicity; there will be no dose reduction. Up to 30 subjects will be enrolled. \n",

      " In the U.S., morbidity associated with human rhinovirus (RV) infection represents a major health problem. In asthmatics, up to 80% of asthma exacerbations are associated with upper respiratory infections. Despite evidence that environmental oxidant pollutants, such as ozone, may increase the severity of viral disease, the mechanisms underlying such an effect have not been identified. This study will test the hypothesis that exposure of allergic asthmatic subjects to ambient levels of ozone directly enhances viral disease by increasing infectivity and intensifying virus-induced inflammation. \n",

This information will improve our understanding of the risk associated with oxidant pollutant exposure in this population of individuals in whom RV infection may represent a significant health concern. \n",

Toxicological data for asthma exacerbations from particulate matter (PM) suggests that particle deposition in the lower respiratory tract can cause inflammatory and lung function changes suggestive of asthma pathology. There is now a scientific need to explain epidemiological findings of ambient PM effects on asthmatics at mass concentrations below what is expected (from toxicological data) to be harmful. One possibility is that study participants are encountering unmeasured short-term excursions of particle mass levels capable of inducing adverse reactions in the lung, but this effect is only captured somewhat by the regulatory standard of 24-hour averages. Our research in southern California is vital to the current controversy regarding regulatory standards given that a health-based scientific rationale for any specific PM averaging time is not established. \n",

      " Ozone is an air pollutant formed in at ground level by the chemical reaction between oxygen and automobile emissions in the presence of sunlight. The objective of this research is to determine how lung size, chemical composition, and normal functioning of the respiratory system affect the amount of inhaled ozone that reaches internal sites of tissue irritation and damage. To infer the distribution of inhaled ozone within the respiratory system, measurements of ozone concentration and air flow are made just outside the nose and mouth of healthy subjects who breathe laboratory-generated, ozonated air for about one hour. Biochemical composition of respiratory mucus is then inferred from nasal washings made with salt water. The amount of ozone that a subject retains in one of these experiments is less than the daily exposure in a large city such as New York or Los Angeles. \n",
      " Ozone is a ground-level air pollutant generated primarily by the photochemical reaction of automobile emissions. The primary objective of this research is to determine the mechanism by which anatomical, physiological, and biochemical factors influence the longitudinal distribution of respiratory ozone dose that is delivered to respiratory tissue during a particular exposure condition. The specific aims are: 1) test the hypothesis that an increase in respiratory flow increases the sensitivity of ozone dose to antioxidant levels in the epithelial lining fluid. Ozone absorption will be measured in the nose of healthy nonsmokers at different nasal flows while antioxidant levels are measured in nasal liquid; 2) test the hypothesis that the continuous inhalation of ozone and co-pollutant gases affects antioxidant levels in the epithelial lining fluid, thereby modulating the ozone dose. Ozone absorption and antioxidant levels in nasal lavage will be intermittently measured in the nose of healthy nonsmokers while these subjects are continuously exposed to clean air, ozone, nitrogen dioxide or sulfur dioxide during quiet nasal breathing for two hours; 3) test the hypothesis that antioxidant concentrations in epithelial lining fluid are directly related to plasma concentrations so that ozone absorption are modulated by the appropriate pharmacological or dietary interventions. The longitudinal distribution of ozone absorption will be measured throughout the conducting airways of healthy nonsmokers during quiet nasal breathing. Measurements will be repeated at baseline conditions, after using probenecid to pharmacologically reduce systemic urate, and after vitamin C supplementation to increase systemic ascorbate; 4) quantify the reaction kinetics between ozone and antioxidants in epithelial lining fluid. Samples of nasal liquid will be reacted with a controlled flow of ozone in a miniature bioreactor to determine the reaction rate constant and reaction order of ozone consumption; and 5) further develop a single-path diffusion model. Respiratory absorption as well as in vitro reaction kinetics data will be used to validate a mathematical ozone dosimetry model that can predict the longitudinal distribution of ozone dose to airway tissue. \n",

      "Title = Ultrasound and Motivational Enhancement for Prenatal Smoking Cessation.\n",
      " The primary purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to test the efficacy of motivational enhancement (ME) therapy combined with biologic feedback (fetal ultrasound) for increasing smoking quit rates among low-income pregnant women considered resistant smokers. We hypothesize that ME along with biofeedback will increase the rate of validated smoking cessation at 8 months gestation by at least 10 percentage points above that produced by \"Best Practice\" (BP) counseling alone. This study will also examine reduction of smoking among non-quitters and maintenance of smoking cessation through 6 weeks postpartum among women who quit. Prenatal smoking is the leading preventable cause of low birth weight in the US. Reduction in smoking during pregnancy could result in significant improvements in pregnancy outcomes and reducing the cost of health care. There is evidence that low-intensity pregnancy smoking cessation programs may be inadequate for women who are more addicted, and at educational and economic disadvantage. Motivational enhancement strategies have shown considerable promise in the treatment of addictive behaviors. Physiological feedback highlighting prenatal effects of smoking and benefits of cessation has been found to enhance prenatal smoking cessation counseling. An intervention that combines motivational enhancement counseling and physiological feedback may have powerful effects beyond low-intensity interventions or usual counseling. \n",
      " Targeting women who deliver at one of the two UT-Houston teaching hospitals, Lyndon B. Johnson (LBJ) and Hermann Hospitals, pregnant women between 18 and 28 weeks gestation will be recruited from University of Texas/Harris County Hospital District-affiliated clinics, including Acres Homes, Aldine, Settegast, Baytown, and Squatty Lyons, LBJ and Hermann Hospital outpatient clinics, private practice OB/GYN's with patients who will deliver at Hermann Hospital, and area WIC (Women, Infants and Children) Program sites. Participants will be randomized to one of three groups, including 1) best practice (BP) counseling, 2) BP plus ultrasound, and 3) BP plus ultrasound plus motivational enhancement (ME) counseling. Counseling and cotinine testing will be performed at the University Clinical Research Center (UCRC) initially, at 34 weeks, and at 6 weeks postpartum. The primary outcome is the rate of smoking cessation among the women at 34 weeks gestation. Based on previous reports, projected quit rates for the 3 interventions, BP, BP + ultrasound, and BP + ultrasound + ME are .06, .12, and .20, respectively. A sample size of 360 will be necessary in order to observe these differences in quit rates. The chi-square test for trend in proportions will be used to determine statistical significance for this primary outcome. \n",

      "Title = Study of Tongue Pressures.\n",
      " This study will examine tongue strength and endurance, how the tongue applies pressure during swallowing, and how the chin muscles react during swallowing in healthy volunteers and in patients with dysphagia (difficulty swallowing). The information from this study may be helpful in developing better treatments for people with swallowing problems. Healthy volunteers who have no history of speech, swallowing or breathing problems and patients who have difficulty swallowing because of a neurologic disorder, musculoskeletal disease or head and neck cancer that caused tongue weakness and dysphagia may be eligible for this study. Such medical conditions may include stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis corticobasal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, Gaucher's disease, leukodystrophy, cerebral palsy, myositis, or mouth, throat or neck cancer. Volunteers who have not participated in a NIH protocol for 1 year will be screened with a brief medical history and physical examination. Dysphagic patients not currently enrolled in a NIH protocol will also have a brief medical history and physical examination. In addition, they will have a modified barium swallow to determine the nature and degree of their swallowing difficulty. Participants will have a 15-minute examination of movements of their tongue, lips and jaw and will fill out a questionnaire about their swallowing ability. They will then begin the tongue pressure test. To monitor and record tongue pressure, a thin rubber strip with air-filled pressure bulbs will be attached to the roof of the mouth with dental adhesive. The pressure bulbs are connected to an external pressure-reading device. In addition, a small plastic pad with adhesive backing will be placed under the chin. Electrodes (wires) attached to the pad record chin muscle activities. With the pressure bulbs and chin electrodes in place, the patient will perform tongue pressure tasks to test tongue strength, how long the patient can maintain a certain tongue pressure, and how fast tongue pressure drops. The tasks include saliva swallows, water swallows and cup-drinking. \n",
      " The tongue enacts complex mechanical events during swallowing, the most important of which is the propulsion of a bolus from the oral cavity to the pharynx. Successful bolus transport requires the tongue to interact with other oral structures, especially the hard palate, to generate sufficient impulsive force or pressure gradients that drive the bolus toward the oropharynx. Our knowledge of deglutitive lingual pressure dynamics is at best incomplete. The available data on oral tongue pressure phenomena are based exclusively on commanded single swallows. Oral pressure changes during other important everyday eating activities (e.g., cup drinking) have not been studied to date. Past investigations revealed that rapid sequential swallowing during continuous drinking, in contrast to commanded discrete swallows, had unique tongue-palate contact patterns, surface electromyographic response characteristics, and hyoid displacement profiles. Given the different biomechanical properties and motor strategies, we hypothesize that oral lingual pressure profiles for sequential swallowing are also different, that sequential swallows require less impulsive force, and that selected dysphagic patients, especially those whose swallowing deficits are associated with reduced tongue strength, will perform sequential swallows more efficiently than they do discrete swallows. This protocol, therefore, proposes to test these hypotheses in healthy individuals of different ages, and in patients with reduced tongue strength and oral-oropharyngeal dysphagia associated with neurologic disorders, musculoskeletal diseases, or head and neck cancer. Our goals are to: (a) acquire a better and more complete understanding of normal tongue pressure phenomena as a function of swallowing tasks, (b) characterize the interrelationship between task-induced lingual pressure differences and result of clinical diagnostic tests of swallowing function in patient populations, and (c) differentially identify the profiles of dysphagic patients who can and those who cannot benefit from sequential swallowing as a compensatory/rehabilitative strategy. \n",

      " Infection by Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most frequent opportunistic infection observed in HIV-infected children. PCVs are immunogenic and efficacious in normal children and offer hope of reducing pneumococcal infections in HIV-infected children. The degree to which children on HAART are protected by prior immunizations and are responsive to new immunizations is still largely undefined. This study is designed to answer whether PCV immunizations are safe and effective. The immune responses to prior immunizations and responsiveness to booster doses of vaccines against measles, pertussis, and hepatitis B virus of children on HAART will also be examined. Answers to these questions will determine whether these children are likely to be protected against these clinically relevant pathogens and whether they should routinely receive booster doses of these vaccines after a period of HAART. Patients are stratified on the basis of CD4 percentage and age. Patients that previously received a primary hepatitis B vaccine (HBV) series receive an HBV immunization at entry. Other vaccinations may be given (based on age and/or CD4 cell measurement, and immunization status) for PCV at entry and 2 months, and measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and PPV at 4 months. Some patients may be administered DTaP at a 6-month visit on the basis of age, previous immunization history, and negative tetanus antibody status. Follow-up visits are done at 8, 12, and 24 months.

      "Title = HIV Maintenance Therapy With T-20 During HAART Interruption.\n",
      " This study will evaluate whether a drug called T-20 can slow or prevent a rapid return of HIV in the blood when HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) is stopped temporarily. HAART is a multi-dose regimen that is very effective in suppressing HIV and perhaps slowing or halting progression of the viral infection towards AIDS. However, this treatment is not problem-oriented. It cannot completely rid the body of virus, and long-term therapy carries a risk of toxicity (harmful side effects). Moreover, the treatment is difficult to adhere to because of the many pills and capsules that must be taken daily. When patients stop taking HAART, their viral levels climb again. This study will see if T-20 can prolong the time it takes for HIV blood levels to rise in patients who stop HAART temporarily. The results may provide insight into possible new HAART-sparing treatments. HIV-infected patients 18 years of age and older who have received HAART for at least 1 month may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, blood and urine tests and possibly a chest X-ray and electrocardiogram (EKG). Participants will receive either 100 Mg. of T-20 twice a day or 200 Mg. once a day, injected under the skin, and their normal HAART regimen for 3 days. (Patients or a caregiver will be taught how to give the T-20 injections.) On the fourth day, HAART will be stopped and all patients will receive 100 Mg. of T-20 twice a day for 6 weeks. Blood will be drawn weekly from the second to the sixth week after stopping HAART to check viral levels and CD4+ T cell counts. At the end of the 6 weeks, T-20 will be stopped and HAART will be restarted. Patients will then be evaluated once a month until their viral level is less than 50. The final clinic visit will be one month after this time. In addition to blood draws, patients will undergo leukapheresis before beginning T-20 and possibly again when they restart HAART and at the end of the study. For this procedure, whole blood is collected through a needle placed in an arm vein, similar to donating blood. The blood circulates through a machine that separates it into its components. The white cells are then removed, and the red cells, platelets and plasma are returned to the body, either through the same needle used to draw the blood or through a second needle placed in the other arm. The white cells are used to study T cell function and levels and to detect hidden virus. \n",
      " Although highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) effectively suppresses HIV replication, it is now clear that it cannot completely eradicate HIV from infected individuals. We have also recently begun to appreciate more fully the scope of toxicities and inconveniences associated with HAART medications leading to difficulties with adherence. Thus, long-term use of HAART may be problematic in many HIV-infected individuals. These realizations have led to a search for strategies to shift the focus from eradication to suppression of HIV replication while reducing toxicity and enhancing compliance. One approach to achieve these goals is to attempt to find strategies that allow for prolonged periods off HAART medications. Recently, Trimeris corporation has developed T-20, an inhibitor of HIV fusion to T-cells, a step required to spread virus from cell to cell. This new class of therapy, which has little recognized toxicity, could be used to allow patients to discontinue HAART medications for prolonged periods of time. In this intent to treat pilot study, we propose to evaluate the ability of T-20 to slow or prevent rebound of plasma HIV RNA when HAART medications are interrupted for a single 6 week period. The information obtained through this investigation could provide important insights into novel therapeutic strategies for HIV infection. \n",

      " The purpose of this research study is to investigate the mechanism of action of a new investigational medication (drug), NNC 90-1170, which is being developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (adult onset type of diabetes. NNC 90-1170 is a modified form of a hormone, Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 (or GLP-1), which is important for controlling insulin levels. Insulin, another hormone, is also important for controlling blood glucose levels, which are higher than normal in people who have type 2 diabetes. This study will measure the effect of NNC 90-1170, active investigational drug, to cause insulin to be released from the pancreas in response to increasing blood glucose concentrations. These results will be compared to that of a group of healthy volunteers of similar age and body weight who do not have diabetes. Also, various other hormones and substances that are known to control blood sugar will be measured in blood samples that will be drawn. One dose of NNC 90-1170 will be given to subjects with type 2 diabetes only in this study, and the effects of this dose will be compared to a placebo (inactive substance that looks like the active drug). This is a crossover study, which means that subjects will be treated both with NNC 90-1170 and with placebo. The order in which subjects will receive the treatments will be determined by chance (randomly). The study will be conducted as a so-called \"double-blind\" study, meaning that neither subjects nor study doctors will know the order in which subjects will be given each treatment until the study is over. The study will include approximately 15 healthy volunteers and 15 volunteers with type 2 diabetes, and it will be conducted at 1 clinic (the University of Michigan Health System) in the United States. \n",

      " The ability of the brain to use its major fuel, the sugar glucose, is reduced in Alzheimer's disease. A nutritional supplement has been developed to improve the function of the Alzheimer brain by increasing its ability to use sugar effectively. The ingredients of the supplement are natural products, and are found in the normal American diet. Results have been encouraging in open trials where the patients knew they were taking the active medicine. Patients are now being invited to participate in a placebo-controlled trial lasting 3 months, followed by a 3-month open label trial where all patients will receive the active preparation. This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 3 month trial followed by a 3-month open-label period, of a nutritional supplement designed to improve brain metabolism and function in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The design of the nutritional supplement is based on replicated observations of abnormalities in mitochondria in AD. The constituents of the nutritional supplement are components of the normal American diet, and are classified by the FDA as GRAS (Generally Regarded As Safe). Results with the supplement have been favorable in preliminary, open trials (eg mean improvement in MMSE score of +4.9, range +3 to +8, n = 7, P <0.0004). During the placebo-controlled portion of the trial, half of the participants will receive the active preparation and half a sugar pill. During this first phase, neither the patients nor those testing them will know who is taking active medicine and who is taking placebo. The active supplement or placebo are taken as 1 tablespoon twice a day, between meals. If desired, the supplement or placebo can be stirred into, or washed down with, water, coffee or tea without milk or sugar, or the soft drink TAB. Patient visits to the Burke Medical Research Institute will be once a month, after the screening and baseline visits. The supplement is taken as one tablespoon of a fluid, between meals. Since other sugars or citrate can be expected to interfere with the actions of the supplements, food or drinks containing sugar or citrate and diet drinks containing citrate are to be avoided for 1 1/2 hour before and 1 1/2 hour after taking the supplement. No significant adverse events have been associated with this supplement. However, standard precautions for patient safety are being taken, including medical examination and clinical laboratory tests at screening and at the completion of the double-blind and open-label phases. \n",

Recent improvements in computer video hardware permit calibration, characterization, and accurate rendering of eye-chart-quality letters. The computer can then be used to measure acuity. The modified binary search (MOBS) testing strategy is one method of computer-based testing. This study will compare the accuracy, precision, stability and utility of the MOBS technique with the eye chart method used in the National Eye Institute's Early Treatment for Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS). The ETDRS method is currently the gold standard for acuity testing in clinical trials. Study subjects will include NEI clinic patients between 7 and 90 years of age with or without eye disease. Eye diseases include poor visual acuity, age-related macular degeneration, cataract, optic nerve abnormality, corneal abnormality, uveitis, glaucoma, other retinal or choroid abnormality, amblyopia or other eye disease. Participants will have their vision tested in each eye using both the ETDRS eye chart method and the MOBS method. The ETDRS method will require subjects to read all the letters on the chart until they can no longer see the details. For the MOBS method, they will read a single letter at a time that will appear on the computer screen. After reading each letter, a new letter will be presented that is either bigger or smaller in size. After completing the last acuity test, participants will fill out a questionnaire regarding their preference for one test type over the other. \n",
      " The primary objective of the project is to develop a valid, reliable, better standardized and more efficient test of visual acuity for use in clinical trials. Accuracy, precision, stability, and utility of the test will be assessed for non-inferiority with Early Treatment for Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) protocol, the gold standard for acuity testing in clinical trials. The experimental protocol (EVA-MOBS {Electronic Visual Acuity - Modified Binary Search}) utilizes a testing strategy that would appear to increase the efficiency and standardization of acuity threshold determination. A more efficient test is justified on the basis of reducing subject burden. Increased measurement efficiency may also reduce both subject- and tester-based bias, while allowing a better means to assess measurement stability through the collection of repeated measures data. As part of the standard eye examination, replicated visual acuity assessments will be made during regularly-scheduled Clinic visits. Up to 500 opportunistically-sampled subjects from the National Eye Institute will be tested both with the ETDRS and EVA-MOBS protocols over a 12 month study period. Similar testing will take place at two other institutions (Devers Eye Institute, Portland, OR; The Retina Foundation of the Southwest, Dallas, TX) and the data from all three institutions will be combined and analyzed at the JAEB Center (Tampa, FL). Subjects will range in age from 7 years to 90 years and will be classified by clinical diagnosis (normal, high refractive error, age-related macular degeneration, cataract, optic nerve abnormality, corneal abnormality, uveitis, glaucoma, retinal/choroid abnormality, amblyopia and other criteria). First, those with poor acuity will be oversampled by increasing the chance that they will be selected for this testing. Second, patients will only be selected for this extra testing if it will not seriously delay clinic operations on any given day. Order of acuity test type will be randomized. It is estimated that up to 10 patients per day can have this testing performed without compromising clinic operations. The experimental protocol runs on a Palm handheld that is used to provide instructions to the tester, record the subject's responses, and communicate with a PC/monitor at a test distance of 3 meters. Stimuli are high contrast black-and-white ETDRS letters presented on an ultra high resolution FD Trinitron monitor, that subtend 2.5 to 200 min of arc; each letter appears in isolation under equiluminant conditions, and is flanked with black bars to simulate visual crowding. Acuity scores will be compared, with the ETDRS score serving as the reference standard. Stability of the acuity estimates from the EVA-MOBS protocol will be assessed with data from repeated measures. A short questionnaire will be administered, following the last acuity test, to determine whether a test type preference exists. If results indicate that the protocol is well tolerated by clinical populations and that thresholds are accurate, precise, and stable, the method will be standardized for use in future trials. Use of stimuli to test visual resolution acuity, such as the Landolt-C, may subsequently be evaluated. \n",

      " The Williams syndrome is a disease in which supravalvular aortic stenosis, an elfin facies, mental retardation and other congenital defects are sometimes associated with abnormal vitamin D and calcium metabolism. Whereas some patients have been reported to show increased sensitivity to vitamin D or an exaggerated response of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D {25(OH)D} to administration of vitamin D and to have hypercalcemia caused by increased circulating 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D{1,25(OH)2D} in infancy and early childhood, most patients have normal calcium metabolism and normal values for circulating 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D. We propose to carry out further studies of vitamin D metabolism to elucidate the mechanism(s) for abnormal vitamin D metabolism. We will determine the response of serum 1,25(OH)2D to administration of 1,25(OH)2D3. Measurement of the 1,25(OH)2D in the patients compared to normal subjects will be the primary outcome. \n",

      " This study will measure and compare the levels of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in the blood of people with and without risk factors for atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) to see if there is a relationship between these cells and cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, high cholesterol level and high blood pressure. Healthy male volunteers between the ages of 21 and 55 years with and without heart disease risk factors may be eligible for this study. Candidates must have no evidence of coronary or peripheral vascular disease, proliferative retinopathy, or other chronic disease and no history of cancer, migraine-type headache, cluster headache, raised intraocular pressure, raised intracranial pressure, hyperthyroidism. Participants will undergo the following procedures at the NIH Clinical Center: - Medical history and physical examination - Blood tests to measure EPC level and various risk and growth factors - Brachial reactivity study - This ultrasound study tests how well the subject's arteries widen. The subject rests on a bed for 30 minutes. An ultrasound measuring device is placed over the artery just above the elbow. The size of the artery and blood flow through it are measured before and after inflating a pressure cuff around the forearm. The pressure cuff stops the flow of blood to the arm for a few minutes. After a 15-minute rest, the drug nitroglycerin is sprayed under the subject's tongue. Before the nitroglycerin spray and 3 minutes after it, the size of the artery and blood flow through it are measured again. \n",
      " Evidence suggests that risk factors for atherosclerosis contribute to atherogenesis by causing endothelial injury. However, little is known about determinants of endothelial cell repair and regeneration. We propose that mobilization of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) constitutes one mechanism for ongoing endothelial repair. EPCs are a bone marrow derived cell population that can be isolated from peripheral blood. Among human peripheral mononuclear cells, EPCs are relatively abundant with an estimated frequency of 1 in 500 to 1 in 1000 cells. Evidence suggests that EPCs can participate in angiogenesis under pathophysiological circumstances. Under normal conditions, however, adult organisms undergo little if any active angiogenesis. One explanation for this set of observations is that high circulating levels of EPCs may exist to allow these cells to participate in functions beyond angiogenesis. We hypothesize that one such function is in the repair of ongoing endothelial injury. To test this hypothesis, we will measure peripheral blood EPC activity by ascertaining the number of EPC colony forming units from peripheral blood sampling. We intend to correlate this biological determinant with the degree of endothelial dysfunction assessed by flow-mediated brachial artery reactivity, and an atherosclerotic risk stratification method developed by the Framingham study. We hypothesize that a correlation will exist between the atherosclerotic risk profile, endothelial function and EPC activity and that the EPC activity will therefore become a novel surrogate biological marker for cumulative cardiovascular risk. \n",

The schizophrenia trial is being conducted to determine the long-term effects and usefulness of antipsychotic medications in persons with schizophrenia. It is designed for people with schizophrenia who may benefit from a medication change. The study involves the newer atypical antipsychotics (olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, clozapine, and ziprasidone)and the typical antipsychotics (perphenazine and fluphenazine decanoate). All participants will receive an initial comprehensive medical and psychiatric evaluation and will be closely followed throughout the study. For most participants the study will last up to 18 months. Everyone in the study will be offered an educational program about schizophrenia and family members will be encouraged to participate. \n",
      " This trial will consist of 1600 patients with schizophrenia for whom a medication change may be indicated for reasons of limited efficacy or tolerability. All patients will receive some psychosocial treatment through study participation. Research participants and their family members will be offered psychosocial interventions directed at improving patient and family understanding of the illness, decreasing the burden of illness in the family, maximizing treatment adherence, minimizing relapse, enhancing access to a range of community-based rehabilitative services and improving study retention. Phase I: Patients will be randomly assigned to one of five treatment conditions for up to 18 months: 1. 320 begin double-blind treatment with perphenazine (PER) 2. 320 begin double-blind treatment with olanzapine (OLZ) 3. 320 begin double-blind treatment with quetiapine (QUET) 4. 320 begin double-blind treatment with risperidone (RIS) 5. 220 begin double-blind treatment with ziprasidone (ZIP) Phase IA: 100 patients screened and found to have tardive dyskinesia who would otherwise be eligible for the study will be randomly assigned to one of the four atypical drugs in Phase IA. Phase IB: Patients who fail treatment with perphenazine in Phase I will be randomly assigned to olanzapine, quetiapine, or risperidone in Phase IB. Phase II: Patients who discontinue their initial assigned atypical antipsychotic treatment in Phase I, IA, or IB for any non-administrative reason will proceed to their second assigned treatment (third for Phase IB patients) and will be followed for up to the remainder of their 18-month participation, as follows: 1. Patients originally assigned to one of the newer atypical antipsychotics who discontinue due to efficacy failure will be randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with one of the other two newer atypical antipsychotics (OLZ, RIS, QUET) which they had not previously received (50%) or with open label clozapine (50%). 2. Patients originally assigned to one of the newer atypical antipsychotics who discontinue due to tolerability failure will be randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with one of the other newer atypical antipsychotics (OLZ, RIS, QUET) which they had not previously received (50%), or with ziprasidone (50%). Until ziprasidone is activated, all patients will be assigned to one of the other atypical antipsychotics. Phase II will last at least 6 months, even if that means participants stay in the study for more than 18 months Phase III: Patients who discontinue Phase II will be recommended open treatment with the preferred regimen based on their treatment history in the study. The treatment options include clozapine, newer atypical antipsychotic (olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, ziprazidone, and aripiprazole), fluphenazine decanoate, perphenazine, and dual antipsychotic therapy using two of these drugs.

      " The purpose of this study is to see if the full daily dose of Combivir (zidovudine [ZDV]/lamivudine [3TC]) taken once a day is as effective as the usual recommended twice-a-day dose. Studies have shown that the antiviral activity of ZDV can continue in the body even after there does not appear to be any ZDV left in the blood. This occurs because the body breaks down the drug into substances that remain active against HIV. The body also breaks down 3TC, a drug that is combined with ZDV in the Combivir product, in a similar way. Since antiviral activity may continue after Combivir is removed from the body, it may not be necessary to take the drug as often as once thought. This study carefully measures levels of the active substances in order to find out whether the same amount of antiviral activity occurs with less-frequent dosing. \n",
      " Initial dosing regimens of ZDV were based on the plasma half-life of the drug. However, recent studies of the intracellular metabolism of ZDV have demonstrated that the active anabolite, ZDV-TP, is present within the cell for an extended period of time relative to the drug in the plasma. This suggests that antiviral activity may be present for a sufficient time frame with less-frequent dosing of the drug. Careful comparison of the rate and extent of intracellular phosphorylated ZDV metabolites as a function of schedule will determine whether less-frequent dosing has a sound pharmacological basis. Also, the intracellular metabolism of 3TC is via different enzymes than that of ZDV and there are quantitative differences in the amount of triphosphate formed from both drugs. This study will provide information about intracellular metabolites when both ZDV and 3TC are concurrently administered. This is a study of 2 schedules of Combivir therapy. At study entry or Part I, all patients take Combivir twice daily for the 7-day adherence assessment. Patients who have demonstrated 70 percent or greater adherence [AS PER AMENDMENT 7/20/01: 70 percent compliance with the study regimen for Combivir. This corresponds to taking at least 10 of the prescribed 14 Combivir tablets during the 7 days prior to an adherence assessment, including all scheduled doses in the 24-hour period prior to that assessment.], and have taken all scheduled Combivir doses in the previous 24 hours, have pharmacokinetic samples obtained and are randomized to Group A or Group B in Part II. Group A patients take 2 Combivir tablets once daily; Group B patients take 1 Combivir tablet twice daily. After patients have completed the targeted duration of Part II (7 days for Group A and 7-14 days for Group B), they are assessed for adherence. Patients who have demonstrated 70 percent or greater adherence, and have taken all scheduled Combivir doses in the previous 24 hours, have pharmacokinetic samples obtained and then change to the alternate dosing schedule. Group A patients take 1 Combivir tablet twice daily; Group B patients take 2 Combivir tablets once daily. After patients have completed the targeted duration of Part III (7-14 days for Group A and 7 days for Group B), they are assessed for adherence. All patients who meet the adherence criteria have pharmacokinetic samples obtained. After completion of Part III pharmacokinetic studies, patients have completed the study.

      " This research study is designed to find out if increasing the dietary intake of polyunsaturated fats improves concentration, motor skills and cardiovascular responses under stress. These polyunsaturated fats may also change the chemicals in the brain that control these responses. Specifically, these polyunsaturated fats may raise brain levels of neurotransmitters called dopamine and serotonin. Polyunsaturated fats are important for improving the function of both the brain and the heart. People cannot make these polyunsaturated fats and they can only be obtained from the oils that we eat. For three months subjects will take 8 capsules a day that contain either corn oils flavored with fish oils or fish oil that taste a little like corn oils. Subjects will not be told which oils we expect to work better. An initial evaluation will determine if subjects fit the criteria necessary to enter the study. A battery of tests will be conducted twice, once before starting the capsules and again after three months of taking the capsules. These batteries of tests will include an MRI of the head, paper and pencil tests to evaluate changes in mood, and tests of concentration and motor skills and cardiovascular responses under stress. Two lumbar punctures will be performed to collect cerebrospinal fluid so that changes in neurotransmitters can be evaluated. Subjects will be on a no seafood diet to equalize their dietary intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Subjects will be expected to complete all parts of this study. \n",
      " The central aim of this protocol is to determine if the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic and (DHA) reduce aggressive behaviors among alcoholics in a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial. Aggression will be measured in a well-established behavioral test, the Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm. Secondary and tertiary aims are to determine if supplementation will improve neurochemical mechanisms and cardiovascular abnormalities that are linked to the pathophysiology of aggression. A testing battery will be done before supplementation (baseline) and compared to the same battery repeated after three months of supplementation. This battery will include 1) psychometric measures (aggression, depression and impulsivity), 2) a neurochemical measure (a lumbar puncture for assessment of cerebrospinal fluid 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid [CSF 5-HIAA], a metabolite of serotonin), and 3) a measure of cardiovascular physiology (heart rate variability). The research participants will be randomized to consume four 1-gram capsules/ d containing either 1.88 grams of DHA plus EPA (active) or reference oils containing corn oil and 1% fish oil for flavor blinding (placebo). Research participants will be aggressive recovering alcoholics defined as scoring 20 or more on the Coccaro Lifetime History of Aggression Scale and who eat seafood no more than once per week. If these inexpensive nutrients reduce aggression or the related neurochemical and cardiovascular measures, these findings will be readily applicable to many aggressive populations. \n",

      " This study will test whether inhaling nitric oxide gas can improve blood flow to the heart, ventricular function, exercise tolerance in patients with coronary artery disease and chest pain that has not improved with medical or surgical therapy. Patients with coronary artery disease who have chest pain despite treatment with medicines and angioplasty or surgery may be eligible for this study. Those enrolled will receive monetary compensation for their participation in this study. The duration of the study is 5 days, with 2 testing periods lasting 2 days each. During one of the periods, the study participants will breathe nitric oxide mixed with room air through a face mask during the tests. During the other period, the participants will breathe room air alone through a face mask during the tests. At least 1 day will separate the treatment periods. During each of the 2 treatment periods (nitric oxide and room air), participants will undergo 4 tests to determine whether the treatment improves the heart's response to stress with increased heart rate and contraction. Approximately one hour before each of the tests, participants will breathe either nitric oxide mixed with room air or room air alone through the face mask, and continue the inhalation treatment while each test is being performed. The face mask will be removed at the end of each test. On the morning of the first day of each treatment period, participants will have a special echocardiogram with imaging of the heart. The echocardiogram will be performed during an infusion of dobutamine, a medicine that increases heart rate and contraction, and serves to stress the heart. This manner of stress testing is commonly used in hospitals around the country to determine if walls of the heart are receiving sufficient blood supply. That afternoon, participants will undergo a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study of the heart. The MRI will determine the heart's blood flow and contraction while receiving the same dosage of dobutamine as was used earlier in the day. On the morning of the second day of each treatment period, participants will exercise on a treadmill until moderately uncomfortable chest pain is reported. Later that morning, participants will undergo cardiac catheterization. For the cardiac catheterization, a long tube (catheter) will be placed into a vein of the neck once the skin is numbed with xylocaine. This tube will be positioned within the right atrium of the heart and into a tube-like structure called the coronary sinus, where venous blood exits the heart muscle. A small catheter will also be placed in an artery of the upper forearm after the skin has been numbed with xylocaine. Blood samples will be taken to allow us to measure the amount of nitric oxide transported in the blood. The blood samples will be drawn (through the tube in the heart and through the small tube in the artery) at the beginning of the study and during infusion of dobutamine to stress the heart. The dose of the dobutamine infusion will be the same dose used in the previous day's stress studies. After the completion of the first treatment period, we will stop testing for at least one day. Participants will begin the second treatment period with the inhalation treatment not received during the first treatment period. \n",
      " Although medical therapy and revascularization procedures are effective for relief of chest pain symptoms in many patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), others either do not respond to or tolerate medical therapies, or have failed attempts at revascularization. For this growing number of patients, there is a need for novel therapeutic approaches. The purpose of this protocol is to test the effectiveness of nitric oxide (NO) inhalation therapy for the relief of inducible myocardial ischemia in patients with CAD who have failed conventional attempts at medical and revascularization management. Our hypothesis is that enriched NO transport in blood from the lungs and delivery to the coronary vasculature with NO inhalation will improve blood flow to the myocardium during stress by dilating coronary arteries and arterioles. The primary end-point of this study is improvement in treadmill exercise duration during NO inhalation compared with exercise duration during room air breathing, with secondary end-points selected to provide mechanistic insight as to relief of inducible ischemia by NO, including effects on: 1) arterial delivery and myocardial extraction of NO transport molecules, 2) myocardial perfusion, and 3) global and regional myocardial contractility. This clinical trial is randomized, double-blind, and placebo (room air)-controlled in design, with CAD patients treated with NO (or room air) breathing for approximately 1 hour before each stress test, followed by crossover to the alternate therapy after two days of testing. Demonstration of benefit from NO inhalation could result in an important therapeutic option for CAD patients with few alternatives for the relief of myocardial ischemia. \n",

HIV also affects immune system activity. The results from this study, using healthy volunteers, will be compared to those in another study of HIV-infected patients. This may provide information on immune system activity in aging and HIV. \n",
      " Aging is associated with declines in both cellular and humoral immunity. A consistent observation of the aging immune system is a change in T cells. Another possible mechanism of diminished cellular immunity associated with age includes accelerated lymphocyte apoptosis. Enhanced lymphocyte apoptosis may play an important role in the pathogenesis of HIV disease. This study will use healthy volunteers to confirm and expand upon such observations. Samples from these volunteers will serve as controls to those from the HIV-infected participants of A5015 (a comparison study of 2 age-differentiated cohorts to determine potential mechanisms that might contribute to accelerated HIV-disease progression that is associated with aging). This is a non-treatment study; however, volunteers receive hepatitis A and tetanus vaccinations. Numbers of phenotypically naive CD4+ cells (CD45RA+/CD62L+) are compared between healthy, HIV-seronegative volunteers and HIV-seropositive patients of A5015. An array of assays to assess baseline differences in immune function between these study populations are performed. Expression of markers of activation are compared by measuring the coexpression of HLA-DR+/CD38+ and CD28+ on CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes between these populations. To investigate possible age-associated differences in apoptosis, Fas (CD95+) expression is measured on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells by flow cytometry, and spontaneous apoptosis is assessed using the propidium iodide method. DTH hypersensitivity to skin test antigens, lymphocyte proliferation to mitogens, soluble antigens, recall antigens, and neoantigens are compared between the 2 populations. Antibody responses to vaccination with tetanus and hepatitis A are assessed. Finally, thymic size as measured by CT scan and the frequency of T cells that contain TRECs is compared between these 2 populations. \n",

      " This clinical trial studies fludarabine phosphate and total-body radiation followed by donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant and immunosuppression in treating patients with hematologic malignancies. Giving chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before a donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving total-body irradiation together with fludarabine phosphate, cyclosporine, and mycophenolate mofetil before transplant may stop this from happening. \n",
      " PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the rate of grade III/IV graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in patients treated with low-dose total body irradiation (TBI), fludarabine (fludarabine phosphate), PBSC infusion and immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil and a disease risk-based cyclosporine taper. II. To estimate the risk of graft rejection, GVHD, disease response, non-relapse mortality and the incidence and severity of infectious complications using this treatment strategy. OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups. ARM I (indolent disease): CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) on days -4 to -2 and undergo TBI on day 0.

      "Title = Positron Emission Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging to Evaluate Synovial Blood Flow in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients.\n",
      " This study will test whether positron emission tomography (PET) imaging can be used to measure blood flow to joints in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It will also compare blood flow measurements using PET with measurements obtained with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine how useful MRI is in measuring blood flow to joints. Much of the joint damage in RA is caused by the synovium-the lining of the joint. In RA, the synovium increases in size and destroys bone and cartilage. The synovium maintains its growth by forming many new small blood vessels to nourish it. New drug treatments are being developed to stop the growth of these new blood vessels. The effect of these treatments on the synovium is usually measured by performing a biopsy-removing a small piece of synovium for examination under a microscope. The biopsy requires inserting a needle into the joint to withdraw the synovial tissue. This study will see if changes in blood flow can be assessed accurately using noninvasive imaging procedures, such as PET scanning, instead of a biopsy. Patients 18 years of age and older with rheumatoid arthritis who have at least one tender and swollen knee due to synovitis may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history and physical examination. Participants will have a mold made of the knee to be studied and will have routine blood tests. Women who are able to become pregnant will have a pregnancy test. All participants will then undergo PET and MRI scanning as described below: PET - A needle is used to insert a catheter (small plastic tube) into an arm vein for injection of the radioactive substance H215O. The patient lies in a doughnut-shaped machine (the PET scanner) and a quick scan is done to measure body thickness. Then, a separate scan is taken following each of six or fewer injections of H215O. Each scan lasts about 13 minutes. MRI - The patient lies on a stretcher that is moved into a cylinder containing a magnetic field (the MRI scanner). A special coil is placed over the knee to improve the quality of the images. Earplugs are worn to muffle the loud thumping sound produced by electrical switching of the magnetic fields during the imaging. A contrast agent called gadolinium is injected through a catheter into a vein to improve the quality of the images. An intercom system permits the patient to communicate with the technician at all times during the procedure. \n",
      " Because of the proliferative nature of rheumatoid synovial tissue, many new pharmaceuticals are targeting angiogenesis inhibition as a means of halting synovial growth. Although clinical markers of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) activity may function as surrogate endpoints in trials of these new agents, a non-invasive technique of assessing synovial blood flow would be the ideal outcome measure. PET imaging has been used to quantify blood flow to a variety of tissues, with significant experience at this institution in the area of tumor blood flow analysis. The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of H2 (15)O PET for the measurement of synovial blood flow in patients with RA. In 10 RA patients with active knee synovitis, clinical and radiological (H2 (15)O PET and dynamic MRI) evaluation will be performed. The feasibility of H2 (15)O PET will be evaluated by its reproducibility. We will also evaluate the correlation of dynamic MRI with synovial blood flow measurement by H2 (15)O PET. \n",

      " This is a community-based participatory research program focusing on pesticide contamination in migrant farmworker families. \n",
      " This is a continuation of a community-based participatory research program focusing on pesticide contamination in migrant farmworker communities. Oregon Health Sciences University's Center for Research on Occupational and Environmental Toxicology and the Oregon Child Development Coalition propose to extend the participatory research model that has been developed to increase community capacity and to build knowledge on the nature and extent of childhood exposures to pesticides and resulting health effects. The project includes involvement from representatives of academic institutions, child and family educational, health, and social services, and the agricultural community. We propose to extend our program of research beyond the state of Oregon to accomplish the following specific aims: 1. Develop and validate a pathway model of organophosphate pesticide exposure for children residing near tree fruit orchards, 2. Conduct a longitudinal investigation of pesticide residue analysis, work practices, home characteristics and biological markers of exposure in migrant families residing in multiple homes and communities throughout a year, 3. Evaluate specific neurobehavioral outcomes in Latino children who speak Spanish and indigenous languages, living in homes with measured pesticide residues and in children living in homes with minimal measurable pesticide residues, and 4. Assess effectiveness of accepted methods of intervention including health education and environmental exposure reduction on changing behavior and reducing pesticide exposure in the migrant agricultural community. The project also includes mechanisms to strengthen and expand the partnerships among migrant farmworker communities to increase the capacity of the community to address issues of environmental exposures and health. Training opportunities are provided for youth from the Latino farmworker community in environmental issues in affected communities. In addition to measuring the outcome of our research interventions in modifying exposures to pesticides and resulting health effects we have incorporated a comprehensive evaluation plan including measures to document increased research capacity in the community, leveraging by obtaining additional funding for further efforts, sustainability, culturally appropriate tools, policy or systems change, and impact on the field. \n",

      " To study work-related asthma in a low-income, urban population. \n",
      " BACKGROUND: Work-related asthma is asthma that is attributable to, or is made worse by, environmental exposures in the workplace. Published estimates of the proportion of adult asthma attributable to occupational factors have varied widely, depending on population, methodology, and definitions, from 2 percent to 33 percent. Occupational asthma is of great public health importance because it is potentially preventable, can cause substantial disability, and in some cases is completely curable. Among adults in the United States, asthma has become a major public health problem, with rates most elevated among low income, urban, African American and Latino sectors of the population, and with substantial evidence suggesting potential occupational contributions to the excess rates. These important sectors of the U.S. population have, however, been inadequately represented in the occupational asthma research literature. DESIGN NARRATIVE: This was a case control study of physician-diagnosed asthma, occupation, industry, and workplace environmental exposures designed to evaluate the hypothesis that a substantial component of the asthma burden in a low income, urban, largely minority population was due to occupational factors. The study design addressed a variety of methodologic challenges including healthy worker effects, difficulty contacting and recruiting this potentially high risk population, large numbers of potential etiologic agents, mixed exposures, small workplaces, and low absolute incidence of occupational asthma. The study population was the catchment population of Bellevue Hospital, a general hospital in lower Manhattan, New York City, with busy ambulatory care services that serve low income working communities. Cases and controls were recruited from among outpatients and inpatients at Bellevue Hospital and interviewed face-to-face or by telephone. Occupation, industry, and occupational exposures were determined by questionnaire supplemented by a Job Exposure Matrix. Odds ratios (ORs) of association between asthma and specific industrial, occupational, and exposure categories, controlled for major confounders, were estimated. The ORs were used to calculate occupation- and industry-specific Attributable Fractions, and an overall Population Attributable Fraction of asthma attributable to occupational factors. New onset occupational asthma and work-aggravated asthma were investigated separately. \n",

      " To investigate the inverse association between socioeconomic status (SES) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study cohort. \n",
      " BACKGROUND: It is well known that cardiovascular disease is inversely associated with SES. However, SES may change over time and for socially mobile individuals it is not clear whether the association with cardiovascular disease (CVD) differs for early life SES vs. mid-life SES. Another issue is that an individual may have a relatively high income and/or wealth, but may live in a low SES neighborhood. It would be desirable to separate out the effects of individual level vs. aggregate level SES. Finally, there is limited evidence that the association of SES with CVD may vary according to ethnic group. The bi-ethnic character of the ARIC population makes it a fertile environment to test this hypothesis. DESIGN NARRATIVE: Mechanisms will be identified which explain the strong inverse association between socioeconomic status (SES) over the life course and cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) , a bi-ethnic population-based sample of four U.S. communities. Health outcomes will include non-invasively measured subclinical cardiovascular disease, as well as fatal and non-fatal clinical disease manifestations ascertained over the course of 10 years of follow-up. Earlier life course socioeconomic status and measurements of current socioeconomic status and biomedical cardiovascular risk factors will be integrated with geocoded contemporary social environmental exposures to assess their impact on cardiovascular function, metabolic impairments, allostatic load, and subclinical and clinical disease. Multilevel analyses will be performed with the goal of identifying pathways by which socioeconomic status is related to cardiovascular disease, considering relevant health behavior, life styles, psychosocial stressors/support mechanisms, chronic infection/chronic inflammatory burden, autonomic nervous system dysfunction, and sustained metabolic impairments. The potential modification of the above associations by the social environment will be addressed by these analyses, as well as putative differences by gender and ethnicity. These staged analytic goals are made possible by linking Census-based indicators of the social environment to the rich data resources of the ARIC Study, a bi-ethnic, community-based sample of men and women aged 45-64 years at the time of their baseline examination in 1987-1989. This cohort was re-examined every three years through January, 1999 with ascertainment of SES during childhood, early adulthood and in mid-life, health-relevant behaviors, numerous measurements of risk factors, and measures of subclinical cardiovascular disease such as carotid artery wall thickness, arterial distensibility, retinopathy, and lower extremity arterial disease. These data, as well as validated information on hospital discharge diagnoses and on cause-specific mortality accrued over 10 years of follow-up are available. Additional life course information on the members of the ARIC cohort will be collected during Year 1 of the study. \n",

      " The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that excess, rare, functionally disruptive single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) characterize genes (e.g., the surfactant protein-B gene)(SFTPB) and gene networks (e.g., the pulmonary surfactant metabolic network or other gene networks that regulate alveolar type 2 cell function) associated with increased risk of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). \n",
      " BACKGROUND: Respiratory distress syndrome is the most frequent respiratory cause of death and morbidity in infants less than 1 year of age in the United States. Of approximately 28,500 infant deaths in 2006, 5,421 (19.7%) were diagnosed with respiratory distress as either the primary (1,011 - 3.7%) or secondary (4,410 - 16%) cause of death. Despite improvement in infant mortality rates over the last 20 years, survivors of respiratory distress syndrome with chronic respiratory disease consume twenty times more annualized dollars than unaffected children and 5.9% of all dollars spent on children from 0-18 years of age. More recent estimates including data from California and New York, the Institute of Medicine, and the 2001 Nationwide Inpatient Sample from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project suggest that the average cost of hospitalization for each of the 49,900 infants with a diagnosis of respiratory distress syndrome was $56,800 vs. $10,700 for a premature infant without respiratory distress syndrome. The recent increase in late preterm births has contributed to both the frequency of respiratory distress syndrome and its economic impact. These medical costs do not include the economic consequences of infant respiratory morbidity for families, e.g., absence from work, and early intervention costs to optimize outcome. In addition, despite 2-3 fold greater risk of infant mortality for African American infants than European American infants from all other causes, European American infants have greater risk of death from respiratory distress than African American infants, and this increased risk is not attributable to differences in surfactant phospholipid composition, birth weight, gestational age, or confounding socioeconomic factors. Understanding the genetic mechanisms that cause respiratory distress syndrome is critical for improving outcomes of children in the United States, reducing costs of their health care, and reducing racial disparity in infant mortality. Since the original description of deficiency of the pulmonary surfactant in premature newborn infants by Avery and Mead in 1959, respiratory distress syndrome has most commonly been attributed to developmental immaturity of pulmonary surfactant production. Despite improvement in neonatal survival associated with availability of surfactant replacement therapy for premature infants, gender and race based disparities in disease frequency, morbidity and mortality have persisted, an observation that suggests that genetic factors play an important role in disease pathogenesis. In addition, twin studies indicate high heritability (h2) of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (0.2 and 0.8). Recent clinical reports of monogenic causes of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, statistical association of candidate gene variants with increased disease risk, and studies of targeted gene ablation in murine lineages have also strongly suggested that genetic mechanisms contribute to risk of respiratory distress syndrome in newborn infants. When we examined genetic variants in large population-based and case-control cohorts, we found that the population-based frequencies of individual, disruptive mutations in 3 candidate genes (SFTPB, SFTPC, and ABCA3) (<2%) account for <0.1% of the population attributable risk in term or near term infants, and that individual, rare, disruptive mutations are not associated with disease in case-control cohorts. In addition, when we attempted to establish an association between an intermediate biochemical phenotype (surfactant protein-B peptide mobility on western blot) and SFTPB variants (assessed by complete resequencing) in term and near term infants with and without respiratory distress, we failed to identify a SFTPB variant or combination of variants associated with respiratory distress and altered surfactant protein-B structure. Finally, we have recently found that tagSNPs in genes from gene networks expressed in lung but not part of the pulmonary surfactant network (ion channel, lung remodeling, and unfolded protein response genes) confer race-specific risk of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. These studies suggest that variation in SFTPB, SFTPC, and ABCA3 is under significant purifying selection pressure and that the genetic contribution to neonatal respiratory distress syndrome is based on contributions of rare, independent risk alleles in multiple genes and gene networks. DESIGN NARRATIVE: Rare mutations in the surfactant protein-B gene (SFTPB) and other genes in the pulmonary surfactant metabolic network cause lethal neonatal respiratory distress syndrome in human newborn infants by disrupting metabolism and function of the pulmonary surfactant. Mutation frequencies (<1-2%) in SFTPB and 2 other candidate genes in the pulmonary surfactant network (SFTPC and ABCA3) do not account for heritability of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (h2~0.2-0.8) suggested by twin studies. To develop a comprehensive catalogue of genes and gene networks that account for the heritability of this complex disease, we propose to test the hypothesis that excess, rare, functionally disruptive single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) characterize genes and gene networks associated with increased risk of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. Specifically, using trio whole exome or whole genome sequencing of affected infant (progressive, severe respiratory distress in term or near term infants or children with unexplained interstitial lung disease or other rare lung phenotypes)/parent trios, we will identify de novo or recessively inherited pathogenic variants including single nucleotide variants, small insertions/deletions, and copy number or structural variants (>100 kb). To predict pathogenicity, we will use a suite of computational prediction algorithms (e.g., ANNOVAR, CADD). To confirm variants in genes and gene pathways not previously associated with human infant/child rare respiratory phenotypes, we will use GeneMatcher to identify other affected infants with pathogenic variants at the same gene locus or in the same gene pathway or functional testing of identified variants in a variety of cell-based jor model organism models. Using next-generation sequencing technology and state of the art statistical methods to elucidate the genetic complexity of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome and rare infant lung phenotypes will permit the development of personalized diagnostic tools and preventive therapeutic strategies for high risk infants and young children. \n",

      " To investigate the role of genes and energy metabolism in the pathogenesis of obesity in adolescent Black girls. \n",
      " BACKGROUND: The high prevalence of obesity in African-American (AA) women is of public health importance since AA women suffer higher mortality from cardiovascular and renal diseases than do white women. The reason for their marked susceptibility to obesity remains poorly understood though it is now known that AA women manifest lower resting energy expenditure than white women. DESIGN NARRATIVE: This is a multi-pronged metabolic and genetic epidemiologic study to examine two candidate genes (UCP3 and b3AR) implicated in energy metabolism. A total of 600 African American girls, aged 12-15 years, will be screened using buccal swabs as a non-invasive method of obtaining DNA, to determine their UCP3 genotypes as well as b3AR genotypes. An estimated 211 girls will be recruited, selected based on their UCP3 genotype, for measurements of resting energy expenditure and body composition (using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry [DEXA]) in a controlled setting of the Clinical Research Center at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital. Variation in resting energy expenditure will be examined across the genotypes of UCP3 with a large sample. The 2x3 design will allow the investigators to examine whether the effects associated with UCP3 variation are due to the UCP3 locus alone or due to the additive effect or interaction between UCP3 and b3AR. The study will help to elucidate the relationship between variation in two important candidate genes for energy metabolism, UCP3 and b3AR, and inter-individual variation in the levels of resting energy expenditure in this very high risk (for obesity) population. \n",

      "Title = Islet Transplantation for Type 1 Diabetes.\n",
      " The purpose of this study is to test whether the islet cell transplantation procedures and results from a previous study in Edmonton, Canada, can be repeated. The study also is designed to learn more about diabetes control using islet cell transplantation. This is a Phase I/II study (a study that examines effectiveness and looks for side effects). The transplanting of islet cells has been studied in Type 1 diabetic patients whose blood sugar levels will not stay normal, despite intensive insulin therapy. A recent study conducted in Edmonton, Canada, was able to demonstrate that islet transplantation led to insulin independence in a majority of the patients treated. This study extends the results obtained from the Edmonton study, which used islet transplantation in Type 1 diabetic patients with steroid-free immunosuppression. \n",

The transplanting of islet cells has been studied in Type 1 diabetic patients whose blood sugar levels will not stay normal, despite intensive insulin therapy. A recent study conducted in Edmonton, Canada, was able to demonstrate that islet transplantation led to insulin independence in a majority of the patients treated. This study extends the results obtained from the Edmonton study, which used islet transplantation in Type 1 diabetic patients with steroid-free immunosuppression. Eligible patients were randomly selected from the total pool of people who applied through the Immune Tolerance Network. Patients will receive at least 10,000 \"islet equivalents\" per kilogram (2.2 pounds) of body weight. This likely will require 2 separate islet infusions from 2 separate donors. Immediately before the first transplant, patients will be given anti-rejection (immune suppressing) drugs, including tacrolimus and sirolimus (orally) and daclizumab (intravenously). The islets will be infused into the liver through a tube placed in the portal vein. Heparin (a medication to prevent blood clots) will be administered with the islet infusion. A longer-acting form of heparin will also be given by daily injections during the next week after each transplant. After surgery, patients will receive insulin intravenously for 24 hours. Patients will have an abdominal ultrasound and blood tests to determine liver function. If fewer than 10,000 islets were transplanted, patients will continue insulin treatment, with the dosages adjusted if necessary to account for the transplanted islets. They will take daclizumab every 2 weeks for 8 weeks and tacrolimus and sirolimus daily. Patients will be given antibiotics to prevent infections. Blood tests to determine how much immunosuppressant drug is in the blood will be performed until the drug is at a stable level. Periodically there will be tests to see if the islet cells are functioning. Blood will be drawn to check drug levels and for other tests routinely. Daily insulin requirements will be checked, and these will be recorded monthly. Patients will be followed for at least 1 year post last islet transplantation. Additional follow-up may be provided at least annually for up to 9 years post first transplantation. \n",

      "Title = Simplified Drug Regimens for HIV Patients in ACTG 388 or Patients Who Responded to A First Potent Combination Regimen.\n",
      " ACTG 388 was a clinical trial that compared three- and four-drug anti-HIV drug regimens and demonstrated the effectiveness of a three-drug regimen. This study will compare the ability of two different three-drug anti-HIV drug regimens to reduce levels of HIV in the blood. The study will also evaluate whether patients discontinue the regimens because of drug side effects. \n",
      " ACTG 388 was designed to evaluate two four-drug regimens compared with a three-drug regimen in patients who were relatively treatment naive. Based on the increased complexity and toxicity of four-drug regimens and the resultant negative impact on response as compared with three-drug regimens, studies evaluating simplified potent regimens appear warranted. This study will evaluate simpilified drug regimens designed to enhance virologic activity without necessarily increasing the number of antiretroviral drugs. The study regimens will be assessed for both virologic control and tolerability. The study population will include patients previously enrolled in ACTG 388 and patients with prior advanced HIV disease who received and responded to potent antiretroviral therapy without evidence of virologic relapse. Patients will be stratified according to ACTG 388 treatment or non-ACTG 388 study participation. Patients will then be randomized to receive either a protease inhibitor (PI)-sparing regimen of 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) with efavirenz (EFV) (Arm I) or an NRTI-sparing regimen of EFV with lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) (Arm II). Arm I options are enteric-coated didanosine (ddI-EC) plus lamivudine (3TC), ddI-EC plus zidovudine (ZDV), ZDV plus 3TC (or Combivir), stavudine (d4T) plus 3TC, or ddI-EC plus d4T (with exceptions as noted in the protocol). Only LPV/r, EFV, d4T, and ddI are provided by the study; other medications are obtained by nonstudy prescription. All patients are evaluated for safety and for virologic and immunologic responses at Weeks 4 and 8, then every 8 weeks until the study ends. In addition, all patients have assessments for fat redistribution, fasting lipid profiles, fasting insulin levels, venous lactate levels, and treatment adherence. Patients will be followed for 1.5 to 3 years. Interim safety analyses will be conducted in June 2002 and June 2003. Patients in this study may also enroll in A5125s, a fat distribution and bone mineral density substudy. \n",

      "Title = Benefits and Risks of Newborn Screening for Cystic Fibrosis.\n",
      " Although cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common, life-threatening autosomal recessive genetic disorder of the white population, there are often delays in diagnosis and hence start of treatment. Advances of the past two decades have made CF screening feasible using routinely collected neonatal blood specimens and measuring an enzyme level followed by CF mutation DNA analysis. Our overall goal of the study is to see if early diagnosis of CF through neonatal screening will be medically beneficial without major risks. ''Medically beneficial'' refers to better nutrition and/or pulmonary status, whereas '' risks'' include laboratory errors, miscommunication or misunderstanding, and adverse psychosocial consequences. Specific aims include assessment of the benefits, risks, costs, quality of life, and cognitive function associated with CF neonatal screening and a better understanding of the epidemiology of CF. A comprehensive, randomized clinical trial emphasizing early diagnosis as the key variable has been underway since 1985. Nutritional status has been assessed using height and weight measurements and biochemical methods. The results have demonstrated significant benefits in the screened (early diagnosis) group. We are now focusing on the effect of early diagnosis of CF on pulmonary outcome. Pulmonary status is measured using chest radiographs, chest scans using high resolution computerized tomography, and pulmonary function tests. Other factors that we are looking at include risk factors for the acquisition of respiratory pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, quality of life and cognitive function of children with CF who underwent early versus delayed diagnosis, as well as the cost effectiveness of screening and the costs of diagnosis and treatment of CF throughout childhood. If the questions underlying this study are answered favorably, it is likely that neonatal screening using a combination of enzyme level (immunoreactive trypsinogen) and DNA test will become the routine method for identifying new cases of CF not only in the State of Wisconsin, but throughout the country. \n",

      " This study compares air pollution exposures of residents in a South Baltimore community next to major industry with those in a comparison community with much less industry nearby. Parents and children as well as adults alone will be included. Air levels of 3 chemicals that have been found in increased amounts in the community as well as two urinary breakdown products of benzene will be measured. Participants will limit the amount of sorbate preserved foods they eat as this preservative interferes with one of the benzene breakdown products. Benzene air and urine exposure measurements will be compared in each community as well as between communities. By including children and parents we will gather exposure information on children who may be more sensitive that adults to these types of pollution. Lastly, by restricting the amount of food preserved with sorbates, we can decide if this improves the use of ttMA for people exposed to benzene from air pollution. \n",
      " The current study focuses on an environmental exposure assessment of a South Baltimore community residing near a heavily industrialized area. Exposure differences between this community and a reference community that is demographically similar to South Baltimore but has limited industrial impact will be assessed. Participants will include both parent child study pairs and adults. Outdoor, indoor and personal 72 hour badge monitoring for benzene, 1,3-butadiene and carbon tetrachloride will be performed. Two urinary biomarkers for benzene exposure, trans,trans-muconic acid (ttMA) and s-phenylmercapturic acid (S-PMA) will be measured at 3 daily time points over the 3 day period. Past work indicates that ingestion of sorbate preserved foods causes substantial interference with the benzene biomarker, ttMA. Therefore, participants will restrict their intake of sorbate preserved foods during the study. On the day of greatest dietary restriction, a 24 hour benzene personal air measurement will be obtained. Data analysis will include correlations of benzene badge exposure measurements and urinary biomarkers. Air and biomarker benzene exposure data will be compared between communities. Linear regression modeling will be used to determine important explanatory factors of the biomarkers. The inclusion of parent child study pairs will also allow correlation of benzene air levels and urinary biomarkers between parents and children. This will provide exposure information on a potentially susceptible subpopulation, e.g. children, and allow assessment of potential for age-related differences in benzene metabolism. Finally, we will be able to determine if dietary restriction is practical and results in greater specificity of ttMA as a benzene biomarker. \n",

      "Title = Physiologic Studies of Spasticity.\n",
      " This study will provide information about changes that occur in the motor neurons of the spinal cord (the nerve cells that control the muscles) when the motor cortex (the region of the brain that controls movement) is unable to send messages to the spinal cord and muscles in the normal way. This information will help elucidate how the nervous system adapts after injury or disease of the motor cortex. Healthy adult volunteers and adults with a spasticity disorder and moderate weakness may be eligible for this study. Patients will be screened with a medical history, physical examination and diagnostic studies as needed. Healthy volunteers will have a neurological examination. Muscle weakness and spasticity will be evaluated in both groups of subjects. All participants will have electromyography (measurement of electrical activity in muscles) during nerve stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation, described below. (Some patients, such as those with a pacemaker or implanted medication pumps, metal objects in the eye, history of epilepsy and others, will not have magnetic stimulation.) Electromyography - The electrical activity of muscles will be measured either by 1) using metal electrodes taped to the skin overlying a muscle, or 2) using thin wires inserted into the muscle through a needle. Nerve stimulation - The nerves will be stimulated by applying a small electrical pulse through metal disks on the skin of the arm or leg. Transcranial magnetic stimulation - A brief electrical current is passed through a wire coil placed on the scalp. This creates a magnetic pulse, which stimulates the brain. During the test, the participant may be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other simple actions. Nerve block - Some patients will have a nerve block of one of the nerves in the arm. For this procedure, a local anesthetic is injected under the skin to produce numbness and weakness in some arm muscles. \n",
      " Objective: The purpose of this protocol is to characterize abnormalities in motoneuron recruitment in adult patients with corticospinal tract dysfunction using electrophysiologic measures. We wish to determine whether the intrinsic spinal mechanisms for recruitment are abnormal or whether only inputs to motoneurons are changed. This information is pertinent for assessing ways that can ultimately be used to enhance strength in patients with corticospinal tract dysfunction using the existing spinal circuitry. Study Design: Comparison of physiological observations in patients and age - matched control subjects. Study Population: Adults with spastic paresis aged 21-80 and healthy volunteers. Outcome Parameters: Measures of motor unit firing in response to peripheral nerve stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation. \n",

      " As many more premature infants survive, the numbers of these infants with health problems increases. The rate of cerebral palsy (CP) in extremely premature infants is approximately 20%. Magnesium sulfate, the most commonly used drug in the US to stop premature labor, may prevent CP. This trial tests whether magnesium sulfate given to a woman in labor with a premature fetus (24 to 31 weeks out of 40) will reduce the rate of death or moderate to severe CP in the children at 2 years. The children receive ultrasounds of their brains as infants and attend three follow-up visits over two years to assess their health and development. \n",
      " The prevalence of cerebral palsy is increasing as the survival rate of extremely premature infants is improving. Studies have suggested an apparent association between maternal magnesium sulfate administration and a reduced risk of cerebral palsy. Other studies have suggested a possible association between magnesium sulfate and a reduction in neonatal cranial ultrasound abnormalities which may be markers for subsequent development of cerebral palsy. This multicenter trial tests whether prophylactic magnesium sulfate given to women, for whom preterm delivery is imminent, reduces the risk of death or moderate to severe cerebral palsy in their children. Women presenting from 24.0 to 31.6 weeks gestation with advanced preterm labor or premature rupture of the membranes (pPROM) and no recent exposure to magnesium sulfate are randomized to receive either intravenous magnesium sulfate or masked study drug placebo. The study drug is administered as a 6 gram loading dose followed by a 2 gram/hour infusion (or equivalent rate for placebo). If after 12 hours, delivery has not occurred and is not anticipated, the infusion is stopped. No other parenteral tocolytics other than the IV medication may be used. Retreatment with study medication is given any time labor recurs or delivery is anticipated until gestational age is > 34.0 wks. Standard clinical management and therapy is to be maintained for all study patients. Patients are assessed for signs of intolerance to the study medications and maternal data are collected up to hospital discharge. A sample of venous blood is collected and neonatal cranial ultrasounds are performed. Up to three follow-up visits are scheduled over two years where certified examiners, masked to study group assignment, collect physical and neurological data, including a modified Gross Motor Function Classification Scale. The Bayley Scales of Infant Development is also administered. Cranial ultrasounds are reviewed centrally. The primary outcome is a composite outcome of death or moderate to severe cerebral palsy. Secondary outcomes include maternal infectious morbidity, pulmonary edema and placental abruption, neonatal stillbirth and death, intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, neonatal infectious and noninfectious morbidity. \n",

      " A course of steroids given to a mother who is in labor with a premature fetus will reduce the risk of the premature infant dying or having serious complications. This trial will test whether more than one course of antenatal steroids is more beneficial or risky to the infant than a single course. \n",
      " After the NICHD Consensus Development Conference in 1994, the antenatal administration of antenatal corticosteroids (betamethasone or dexamethasone) for prevention of death and the serious morbidities associated with preterm birth has become an accepted standard in American obstetric practice. Studies have shown that maximum beneficial effect occurs when the fetus is delivered within 7 days of antenatal steroid administration. The efficacy and safety of a single course of corticosteroids has been substantiated but it is unknown whether repetitive dosing has similar efficacy or what the maternal, fetal and neonatal risks are. Repeat courses of steroids are often administered. Two popular regimens exist for the patient who remains undelivered more than one week after initial therapy but who remains at risk for preterm birth. In one, steroids are repeated weekly until 34 weeks gestation, while in the other, steroids are only given once. This multicenter trial is testing the safety and efficacy of weekly administration of antenatal steroids. Twenty four hundred women < 32.0 weeks gestation who are at risk for spontaneous preterm delivery and remain pregnant at least seven days after an initial course of corticosteroids are being randomized to either weekly courses of masked study drug (betamethasone or placebo) for 4 weeks or delivery, whichever comes first. Patients are asked about side effects at the weekly visits and samples of maternal blood at randomization and delivery are collected. Cord blood and placentas are also collected. Cranial ultrasounds are done on all neonates. On a subgroup of patients, an adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test is being performed and an auditory brainstem response (ABR) performed. All infants attend a follow-up visit at 18 to 22 months corrected age where certified examiners, masked to study group assignment, collect physical and neurological data. The Bayley Scales of Infant Development will also be administered. A subgroup of infants will be seen at 36 months to administer the Intelligence scale from the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities. \n",

      " This study was conducted to evaluate the cardiovascular risk of prescribing up to 90 mg of methylphenidate (MPD) daily for treating cocaine dependence. This within-subject study was completed in an inpatient setting. It was non-blinded for MPD dose and single-blinded for cocaine dose. Each patient was given intravenous cocaine at 0, 20 and 40 mg while at three different steady state levels of MPD (0, 60 and 90 mg). Seven non-treatment seeking cocaine addicts, who were recruited from the community, completed the study. There were no cardiac rhythm abnormalities noted except for sinus tachycardia and sinus bradycardia. There were no incidences of seizures or myocardial ischemia. In a repeated measures ANOVA, MPD was shown to have an independent positive effect on heart rate (p=0.0001) but not on SBP or DBP. There was no cocaine by MPD interaction for any vital sign. Peak systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) for any patient up to 60 minutes after infusion was 169 mm and 108 mm, respectively. The first occurred when 60 mg of MPD and placebo cocaine were given and the second when no MPD and placebo cocaine were given. Peak heart rate for any patient up to 60 min after infusion was 143/min at 60 mg of MPD and 40mg of cocaine. The number of adverse events reported when cocaine and MPD were given together was less than the number reported when either drug was given alone. The adverse events reported when cocaine and MPD were given together included headache, nervousness, and lightheadedness. Subjective ratings of drug effect revealed that MPD did not enhance patients' response to, or desire for, cocaine. MPD appears to be a safe drug to use in cocaine addicts who continue to use cocaine at the dosages tested. \n",

The three medications being evaluated in this trial include tiagabine, sertraline, and donepzil. Tiagabine is hypothesized to interfere with glutamatergic cocaine mechanisms relevant to addiction. Sertraline is a potent and selective inhibitor of neuronal 5-HT reuptake, which may modulate the reinforcing and cueing effects of cocaine. Donepezil is hypothesized to interfere with cholinergic cocaine mechanisms relevant to addiction. \n",

      " This study will determine whether people with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) with and without gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms have gut abnormalities (inflammation or loss of function) and changes in immune system cells and chemicals in the blood and gut. People with CVID have decreased levels of serum immunoglobulin IgG and IgA. Patients have sinus, lung and other infections, and many also have stomach and intestinal problems, such as chronic diarrhea, inability to absorb nutrition from food, and intestinal infections caused by bacteria. CVID patients with gastrointestinal symptoms 10 years of age and older may be eligible for this study; CVID patients without gastrointestinal symptoms 18 years of age and older will be enrolled as control subjects. Candidates will be screened with a review of their medical records, a medical history and physical examination, HIV blood test, stool sample, and hydrogen breath test. The breath test measures the amount of hydrogen in the breath after drinking sugar water, showing the digestive effects of bacteria in the upper intestine. Participants will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for several days to undergo the following procedures: - Medical history and physical examination - Blood tests - Urine and stool samples - 48-hour stool fat collection measures the amount of undigested fat in the stool to determine the ability of the gut to digest and absorb fat in the diet - D-Xylose absorption test measures the ability of a sugar compound to travel across the lining of the intestine to determine the ability of the gut to absorb nutrients - Upper endoscopy a thin flexible lighted tube is advanced through the mouth to evaluate the esophagus, stomach and beginning of the small intestine - Lower endoscopy a thin lighted tube is advanced through the rectum to evaluate the colon Identification of GI abnormalities associated with changes in immune response in CVID patients will help in developing and testing new treatments for this disease. \n",
      " Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is a clinically heterogeneous disorder characterized by decreased serum immunoglobulin IgG and IgA levels. In addition to chronic or recurrent sinopulmonary infections, many patients develop gastrointestinal manifestations that can be disabling or fatal. Data suggest that these gut abnormalities have a primary immune basis, implicating T cells primarily, and are not related to the infectious complications of CVID. Currently there is no standard therapy for the associated gastrointestinal disease outside of empiric nutritional intervention for weight loss and non-specific anti-diarrheal agents. In addition there is no data about the prevalence of gastrointestinal abnormalities in CVID patients who have no overt gastrointestinal symptoms. The objectives of this study are to characterize the gastrointestinal abnormalities that occur in CVID patients and correlate this with the immunophenotype and cytokine secretion of peripheral blood and lamina propria lymphocytes and monocytes. CVID patients with gastrointestinal symptoms of malabsorption/maldigestion and chronic diarrhea will be targeted for study. We will also include a group of patients without gastrointestinal symptoms to provide an estimate of background prevalence and severity of gut abnormalities. Subjects will undergo a standard immunologic workup including peripheral blood lymphocyte marker phenotyping and cytokine responses as well as tests of gastrointestinal absorption, examination of gut histology by endoscopic biopsy, and measurement of gut mucosal cytokine expression. Analysis variables will include clinical (weight, stool frequency, results of gut absorption tests), laboratory (lymphocyte and cytokine assays), and gut abnormalities (histology scores and specific lesions). \n",

      " The CATIE Alzheimer's Disease Trial is part of the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) Project. The study is for people with Alzheimer's disease who are having trouble with their thinking or behavior. In particular, this study is trying to find out the best treatment for people who have hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren't there), delusions (false beliefs), or agitation. The design of the trial helps to increase the chance that participants in the study receive a medication that helps them. The study uses three medications known as atypical antipsychotics (olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone), which are the newest medications that are currently available for treating these problems. Participants may also receive an antidepressant (citalopram). The trial lasts for 36 weeks. Participants are given a thorough evaluation at no cost to ensure that this study is appropriate. In addition, the caregiver, family member, or friend who comes with the participant will be offered an educational program about Alzheimer's disease. \n",
      " There are four phases. Phase I: In the initial treatment phase (Phase 1), patients will be randomized to one of the three atypical antipsychotics or placebo in the ratio 100:100:100:150 respectively. After two weeks, the investigator can move the patient to the next phase because of lack of efficacy or tolerability. At week 12, the investigator can decide whether the current medication is sufficiently optimal or it would be more beneficial to try another randomized medication. Phase 2: Phase 2 starts when the patient is randomized to a second medication, i.e., olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, or citalopram. Patients will be randomized from an antipsychotic treatment to another antipsychotic treatment or citalopram in the ratio 3:3:2, or from placebo to an antipsychotic treatment or citalopram in the ratio 1:1:1:3 respectively. Therefore, 50% of patients who took placebo in Phase 1 will be randomized to an antipsychotic in Phase 2, and 50% will be randomized to citalopram in Phase 2. After the initial two weeks in Phase 2, the investigator can move the patient to the next phase, due to lack of efficacy or tolerability. After the patient has been on the Phase 2 study drug for approximately 12 weeks, the investigator can decide whether the current medication is sufficiently optimal or whether it would be more beneficial to try another randomized medication. Phase 3: Phase 3 is randomized open-label treatment of one of the medications not previously received, i.e., olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, or citalopram. Treatment failures to the second treatment can be switched to a third open-label treatment. During Phase 3 patients will be maintained on their treatments openly and managed clinically until week 36. If the investigator determines that the patient's response is not sufficiently optimal to the randomized open-label medication, then after the first two weeks of Phase 3, the investigator can prescribe another medication (of the investigator's choice) to the patient. If this occurs then patients are classed as being in the Open-Choice Phase. Open-Choice Phase: The Open-Choice Phase can be entered at anytime during the 36-week study and directly from any of the three phases. There are four reasons a patient can enter the open choice phase: - Withdrawal from Phase 1 or Phase 2 with the patient or surrogate decision-maker refusing to proceed to the next randomized phase; - Withdrawal from Phase 3; - Withdrawal from current study drug from any of the three previous phases due to antipsychotic medication no longer being required in the opinion of the investigator; or - Withdrawal due to concomitant treatment with an exclusionary medication. The Open-Choice Phase is designed to keep patients monitored in the trial for the 36-week duration. \n",

Electrocardiographic changes have also been reported in animals exposed to particles in controlled conditions. We have hypothesized that cardiovascular patients may experience life-threatening arrhythmias associated with particulate air pollution episodes. Implanted cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) devices continuously monitor the heart rhythm, and on detecting arrhythmias can initiate interventions. These devices provide a passive, continuous monitor of cardiac arrhythmias. We are assessing the association between community exposures to air pollution measured by ambient monitors and these cardiac arrhythmias detected by implanted cardioverter defibrillator devices. \n",
      " Records of cardiac arrhythmias detected in patients with implanted cardioverter defibrillators will be linked with measurements of the concentration and constituents of ambient particulate air pollution. Time series methods will be used to assess temporal associations, adjusting for seasonal, weekly, and diurnal patterns, meteorology, and co-pollutants. Characteristics of subjects showing the strongest air pollution associations will be assessed, as well as effect modification by medication and co-morbidities. ICD patients are followed up clinically every three to six months. The ICD device is interrogated and data are retrieved by non-invasive radio frequency retrieval from the implanted device. Device performance is checked. Detected arrhythmias and therapeutic interventions are listed. For each detected episode, date and time is recorded, along with a short electrogram of the heartbeats immediately before and during the event. Daily ambient particle mass (PM10 and PM2.5) and particle constituents have been measured in Boston since January 1995. The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection has measured concentrations of gaseous pollutants including carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and sulfur dioxide. Meteorological factors including temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure have been measured at the National Weather Service station at Logan airport. Meteorologic factors and gaseous co-pollutants will be considered as independent predictors of arrhythmic events, and as confounders of the particulate air pollution associations. \n",

      "Title = Molecular Epidemiology of Childhood Leukemia (Aka The California Childhood Leukemia Study).\n",
      " This study is a case-control study investigating the causes of childhood leukemia in Northern California. The overall purpose of this epidemiologic study is to find specific genetic or environmental factors that may increase the risk of leukemia in children. The study is being conducted by Patricia Buffler, PhD at the School of Public Health - University of California Berkeley in collaboration with the California Department of Health Services and 16 hospitals located throughout the state of California. The study began in 1995 and will continue to 2014. \n",
      " This study is a case-control study of incident childhood leukemia (all subtypes) diagnosed since mid-1995. Children newly diagnosed with leukemia are enrolled in the study. Criteria for inclusion in the study are: under 15 years of age, no prior cancer diagnosis, residency in the state of California at the time of diagnosis, and availability of an English or Spanish speaking parent or guardian. Pre-treatment biological specimens, including bone marrow and peripheral blood, are obtained for analysis in the UCB lab of Dr M. Smith. The lab will use Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) to detect chromosome specific aneuploidy and translocations. A number of chromosomal translocations, including t(9;22) and t(8;21), are known to be centrally involved in the development of childhood leukemia. Molecular characterization of the cases with translocations may provide insight into the timing of critical exposures and the nature of the etiological agent involved. One comparison subject (control) is recruited for each consenting case. For each case, four potential controls are randomly selected from California birth certificate files and matched on date of birth, gender, mother's race, parental Hispanicity, and county of residence. One of the four birth certificate controls is randomly selected to be recruited to participate in the study. An in-depth personal interview asks a variety of questions, including: residential history; occupational and household exposure histories; mothers' reproductive history; events during index pregnancy and delivery; family history of illness; child's health and vaccination history, contact with other children; maternal and child exposure to cigarette smoke during pregnancy and since birth; maternal and child history of x-rays. Saliva specimens are obtained from both cases and controls and their biological mothers. The saliva samples are sent to the study office and processed in the Genetic Epidemiology lab at UC Berkeley. DNA from cases and controls will be analyzed by polymerase chain reaction for genetic polymorphisms. Genetic polymorphisms will be examined in two glutathione transferase genes, M1 and Tl. Case samples of peripheral blood, bone marrow, and archived newborn blood will be also used to detect N-ras mutation. Three tiers of an exposure assessment are being implemented. Tier 1 enrolls and interviews cases and controls seeking to identify risk factors, including residential and occupational chemical exposures. In Tier 2, cases and birth certificate controls that have not changed residence based on specific criteria are part of a reliability study, which seeks to determine if self-reported chemicals used at the time of interview are found in the home during a visual survey several months after interview. Tier 3 aims to document the potential for household exposures by sampling dust on the floor surfaces. The objective is to identify if there are differences in concentrations of pesticides, metals, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, cotinine, polychorinated biphenyls, and ethylenethiourea in the homes of cases and controls. Further, a case-case analysis will identify if cases with chromosomal translocations of interest live in homes with higher concentrations of target compounds than cases that do not have such translocations. These analyses will determine whether leukemic children with common genetic changes experience common exposures and whether these genetic changes have approximately the same temporal occurrence. Finally, we will evaluate whether children with and without leukemia differ with respect to susceptibility. \n",

      " The most persistent and intractable cause of infant and child mortality and morbidity in the US remains preterm and low birthweight deliveries. Pregnant women in the United States experience the highest incidence of these complications among developed countries. Even more disturbing is the observation that immigrant Hispanic women experience worsening birth outcomes the longer they live here, despite increasing access to prenatal care, improved socio-economic status and better education. The purpose of this study is to identify the potential acculturation-related risk factors for preterm and low birthweight (PTLBW) delivery among Hispanic women of varying lengths of US residency. It is hypothesized that changes in factors associated with acculturation, such as poor nutritional intake, job stress and occupational exposures to pesticides or other hazards, and certain types of genital infections, can best explain the worsening of pregnancy outcomes among Hispanic immigrant women. \n",

Pregnant women in the US experience the highest incidence of these complications among developed countries. Despite many efforts at increasing prenatal care, rates of preterm delivery have not substantially changed in the last decade. Even more disturbing is the observation that immigrant Hispanic women experience worsening birth outcomes the longer they live in the US, despite increasing access to prenatal care, improved socio-economic status and better education. (Within five years after moving to the US, the odds ratio for preterm low birth weight delivery increases by 1.9, from 4% to 7%.) As migrant women become acculturated to the US, they must be exposed to factors that adversely affect pregnancy outcomes. But the known risk factors, such as poverty, lack of education, smoking, substance abuse, inadequate pregnancy weight gain, low pre-pregnancy weight, high altitude, chronic diseases, primipara, and high parity, explain only a small percentage of this change in incidence. The prospective study will enroll a cohort of approximately 1500 pregnant Hispanic women attending prenatal care services through an OB/GYN group at the San Joaquin General Hospital in Stockton, CA. The majority of Hispanic women (67%) receiving prenatal care through this group are Mexican immigrants of varying lengths of US residency, and up to 26% of them are involved in farm labor and/or other types of manual labor. Eighteen percent are US-born Mexican women. A study of this unique population of Hispanic women of varying lengths of US residency, and factors related to occupational risks, acculturation and preterm low birth weight deliveries, will provide an excellent opportunity to examine the factors of acculturation-based causes of preterm low birthweight (PTLBW). The investigators hypothesize that job stress and occupational exposures related to farm work can best explain the worsening of pregnancy outcomes among Hispanic women. However, in order to ensure an understanding of the mechanism of this increased rate of preterm low birthweight within this population, this study will also examine other risk factors that could possibly be associated with acculturation and preterm low birthweight. Such factors include changes in nutrition intake, and certain types of genital infections such as Bacterial Vaginosis, Gonorrhea and Chlamydia. The knowledge that emerges will have direct application for designing improved programs for the prevention of preterm low birthweight deliveries among Hispanic women. Just as important, it will provide insight into the underlying causes of the scandalously high rates throughout all US populations. \n",

      " Plasma histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) binds to platelets in the presence of zinc (1). This binding is totally blocked by a monoclonal antibody directed against platelet membrane CD36. Therefore, CD36 is assumed to carry the platelet binding site for HRG (2). Because CD36 also has a variety of other ligands, including polyanionic lipids, it is also possible that it contains the binding site for heparin (also polyanionic) and might be involve in the pathogenesis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Demonstrating absent HRG or heparin binding to platelets lacking CD36 would confirm that the binding sites for either or both of these ligands are located on this membrane protein. Because 3% to 11% of healthy Japanese are reported to lack CD36 on their platelets, this population is a practical source of cells for examining the physiologic role(s) for CD36. Therefore, we will recruit blood donors from the Japanese community on the NIH campus. Their platelets will tested for the presence of CD36. Recruitment will be closed after two individuals have been identified whose platelets lack CD36 and who are willing to donate 30 cc of blood on 4 or 5 subsequent occasions for binding studies with radiolabeled HRG and heparin. \n",

      " This study will test the safety and effectiveness of a new treatment for hepatitis C (HCV) in patients who also have HIV. The usual treatment for HCV in people who are not HIV-infected is interferon-alfa (IFN) with ribavirin (RBV), an approved treatment by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This study will use a new, longer acting form of IFN called PEG-IFN alfa-2b. PEG-IFN alfa-2b is approved by the FDA for use in treating HCV but has not yet been approved for use with RBV. This study also will use IL-2, which is a substance that the body naturally produces. People with HIV infection usually do not make enough IL-2. IL-2 is being tested in this study to see if it will \"boost\" the immune system's response to HCV. The FDA has approved IL-2 for the treatment of some cancers. \n",
      " HCV infection is an increasingly important clinical problem in patients infected with HIV. In HIV-uninfected patients with acute HCV infection, the presence of vigorous T-cell proliferative responses to HCV proteins is associated with normalization of serum transaminase levels and viral clearance. Furthermore, early results suggest IL-2 may improve transaminase levels in HCV/HIV patients. These observations provide the rationale for an immune-based therapeutic approach to HCV/HIV coinfection. This study explores the use of initial immunostimulatory therapy with IL-2 followed by the addition of antiviral therapy with PEG-IFN alfa-2b and RBV, as a possible synergistic approach to treatment. Patients receive IL-2 for 12 weeks followed by the addition of PEG-IFN alfa-2b and RBV at the Week 12 visit. Patients remain on IL-2, PEG-IFN alfa-2b, and RBV for an additional 48 weeks. At Week 60, all study treatment is permanently discontinued and patients continue to be evaluated through Week 84. Toxicity or intolerance is evaluated. Data is collected on biochemical and virologic responses. \n",

      " This protocol provides for emergency treatment with the experimental anti-fungal drug voriconazole for patients with life-threatening invasive fungal infections. The increase in the number of patients whose immune function is suppressed because of chemotherapy, tissue or organ transplantation, or HIV infection has led to an increase in fungal infections. New drugs are needed to combat these infections in patients who do not respond to or cannot tolerate standard treatments. Patients on other primary NIH protocols who have an invasive life-threatening fungal infection that does not respond to currently available treatments or who cannot tolerate these treatments may be eligible for this study. Participants will have a blood test and a physical examination before receiving voriconazole. They will receive voriconazole twice a day either as an infusion into a vein or as tablets taken by mouth. Adult patients will be asked to provide a blood sample any time after the first dose of voriconazole to be used for developing a test to measure voriconazole concentration in the blood. Patients will be evaluated about 10 days after starting treatment and then at least once every 4 weeks with a symptom check and blood test. \n",
      " The increase in the number of immunosuppressed patients as a result of more aggressive chemotherapy, transplantation, HIV infection has lead to an increase in the incidence of invasive fungal infections. Moreover, despite the availability of newer, less toxic preparations of Amphotericin B and azole antifungals such as fluconazole and itraconazole, invasive mycoses remain a therapeutic challenge. Voriconazole is a new triazole that has shown in phase II studies to be very active against Aspergillus sp. Its side effect profile has been very benign, comparable with those of other FDA approved triazoles. In vitro studies also show that voriconazole has a very broad spectrum ranging from opportunistic to endemic fungi. In addition, the availability of intravenous and oral formulations add to its potential advantages because the therapy of these infections usually require long courses on antifungals. In this study, voriconazole is used as a salvage therapy for those patients who are unable to tolerate or who have failed other antifungal therapies. Because of the abundance of immunocompromised patients at our center, we believe that having such a protocol ready for enrollment would mitigate delays in such crucial moments. We seek to enroll and treat 40 patients over a 3 year period. \n",

      "Title = Effects of Flumazenil on Brain Excitability.\n",
      " This study will investigate the effects of the drug flumazenil on brain excitability and the drug's relationship to a natural brain chemical called GABA. Flumazenil is commonly used in hospitals to reverse the effects of a group of drugs called benzodiazepines, one of which is Valium. Benzodiazepines act by enhancing the effects of GABA. Healthy volunteers 21 years of age and older may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history and physical and neurological examinations. Participants will have transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) four times on two different days, before and after receiving an intravenous (through a vein) infusion of either flumazenil or placebo (an inactive sugar solution), as follows: TMS study 1 Drug or placebo infusion TMS study 2 - 15 minutes after infusion TMS study 3 - 60 minutes after infusion TMS study 4 - 120 minutes after infusion In transcranial magnetic stimulation, a very brief electrical current is passed through an insulated coil wire placed on the scalp. These currents stimulate the cortex (outer part of the brain). They may cause muscle, hand, or arm twitching if the coil is near the part of the brain that controls movement, or they may affect other reflexes or movements. During the study, subjects may be asked to make movements, do simple tasks or tense muscles. To record the electrical activity of muscles, electrodes will be taped to the skin over the muscles tested. In some cases, the studies will be videotaped. Flumazenil will be infused through a catheter (thin plastic tube) attached to a needle placed in an arm vein. On one day, subjects will receive a 1-mg injection of flumazenil followed by a continuous infusion of 0.5 mg of the drug for about 30 minutes. On the other day, they will receive placebo, administered in the same manner. \n",
      " The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of flumazenil on cortical excitability in healthy human volunteers. Flumazenil acts as a potent benzodiazepine (BZP)-specific antagonist by competing at the central synaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor site. However, the relationship between GABA and flumazenil without BZPs is not well known. We plan to determine if intravenous (IV) administration in therapeutic dosage alters cortical excitability as measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The long-term plan is to identify a pharmacological method to reduce cortical inhibition that might be useful in stroke rehabilitation. \n",

      " The purpose of this study is to see whether metformin alone, rosiglitazone alone, or metformin and rosiglitazone together will lower insulin levels in the blood and decrease fat in the abdomen or other parts of the body. Studies have shown that certain anti-HIV medications can cause a number of side effects, including high blood sugar (resulting from the body's failure to use insulin), high insulin, and excess fat build-up in the abdominal area. These side effects are known to increase the risk of heart disease. Metformin and rosiglitazone are 2 drugs that have been shown to lower insulin resistance and lessen abdominal fat in patients who are not HIV-infected. This study will investigate the use of these drugs in HIV-infected patients. \n",
      " Recent studies have documented hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance in a seemingly increasing proportion of patients with HIV infection. Other studies have described a variety of syndromes of fat accumulation and fat loss, including abdominal obesity. Although initially attributed specifically to protease inhibitors (PI), these abnormalities also have been observed in antiretroviral-experienced but PI-naive patients. Hyperinsulinemia and abdominal obesity are strong independent risk factors for coronary artery disease. In noninfected patients, metformin and thiazolidinediones have been shown to reduce insulin resistance by different mechanisms and also to reduce visceral adiposity. This study investigates the use of metformin and rosiglitazone, a member of the thiazolidinedione class, in HIV-infected patients with hyperinsulinemia and central fat accumulation. At study entry, clinical and laboratory assessments are performed. A standard OGTT, with plasma samples drawn over 120 minutes, will be performed for glucose and insulin determinations. After completion of entry evaluations, patients are assigned randomly to 1 of 4 double-blinded treatment arms: Arm A: Metformin plus rosiglitazone placebo. Arm B: Metformin placebo plus rosiglitazone. Arm C: Metformin plus rosiglitazone. Arm D: Metformin placebo plus rosiglitazone placebo. Patients who are still on study drugs at Week 16 (at either full or reduced dose) are switched to the open-label phase to receive the combination of metformin and rosiglitazone through Week 32. Patients have evaluations at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 18, 20, 24, 28, and 32. [AS PER AMENDMENT 02/05/02: Evaluations must be performed under fasting conditions.] Safety indices, fasting insulin and glucose levels, visceral [AS PER AMENDMENT 02/05/02: and subcutaneous abdominal] fat are assessed. [AS PER AMENDMENT 02/05/02: Patients who discontinue study treatment due to pregnancy during the study will have the Week 32 evaluations (except CT and DEXA scans).] [AS PER AMENDMENT 02/05/02: A mid-thigh measurement was added to the study as a secondary endpoint to look for changes in extremity subcutaneous fat from therapy with rosiglitazone. Rosiglitazone and other peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma activators increase subcutaneous adipogenesis and may thus increase subcutaneous fat and improve insulin resistance in this way.] \n",

      " Interleukin-2 (IL-2) helps the body make infection-fighting white blood cells, including CD4 and CD8 T cells. One HIV treatment strategy is planned treatment interruption (stopping anti-HIV drugs when CD4 count and level of virus in the blood are at certain levels). The purpose of this study is to see if IL-2 used with potent anti-HIV drugs allows for longer HIV treatment interruptions. \n",
      " One approach in reconstituting an HIV-diminished immune system is the use of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) in conjunction with IL-2. IL-2 is a cytokine secreted by activated T cells that regulates the proliferation and differentiation of CD4 and CD8 T cells. Although treatment with IL-2 can cause temporary increases in HIV viral load, clinical studies with IL-2 have revealed no long-term adverse effects on viral load. IL-2 therapy may also help purge the host's latent viral reservoir through activation of resting lymphocytes harboring provirus. Another approach to managing HIV infection is strategic treatment interruption. Results from small pilot trials suggest that HIV replication can be highly suppressed over consecutive courses of ART following short treatment interruptions, and CD4 T cell counts can be maintained on these interruptions with some positive effect on HIV-specific immunity. This study will evaluate potent ART, started and interrupted based on CD4 cell counts, with or without IL-2. Patients will be stratified based on lifetime CD4 T-cell nadir (lowest measurement) into one of three groups. Group 1 will have a nadir of 200 CD4 cells/mm3; Group 2 will have a nadir greater than 200 CD4 cells/mm3; and patients with no documented nadir count available will join Group 3. Within each group, patients will be randomly assigned to one of two study arms. Arm A patients will receive pulses of potent ART with IL-2, while Arm B patients will receive pulses of potent ART alone. Patients in Arm A will receive potent ART with IL-2 given by subcutaneous injection twice daily for 5 days every 8 weeks for at least 17 weeks. Arm B patients will receive potent ART alone for at least 17 weeks. Both groups then go on treatment interruption for approximately 64 weeks, followed by potent ART alone for an additional 24 weeks. Patients will repeat this cycle of potent ART with or without IL-2, treatment interruption, and potent ART alone throughout the study. This study will last approximately 4 years. Clinical and laboratory assessments will be performed periodically throughout the study. CD4 T cell counts and viral load will determine if a patient can enter the next treatment step. Potent ART is not provided by this study. A5109s is a limited-center substudy designed to determine whether viral replication impairs lymphocyte proliferation in vivo. Patients at substudy-participating sites will register to the substudy immediately after beginning their first treatment interruption in the main study. \n",

      " This study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine if silent strokes occur during angioplasty of the blood vessels in the neck or skull. Neck and skull angioplasties are relatively new procedures whose possible complications are still under investigation. Patients 18 years of age or older who are admitted to Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, for angioplasty of one or more of the blood vessels in the neck or skull may participate in this study. Participants must be able to undergo a brain MRI. Within 24 hours before their angioplasty, patients will provide a medical history and have a physical examination and brain MRI. The physical examination and MRI will be repeated within 24 hours after the angioplasty. MRI is a diagnostic test that uses a magnetic field and radio waves to show structural and chemical changes in tissues. This technique is more sensitive than X-rays in detecting some changes that occur in diseases of the brain. For the procedure, the patient lies on a table that slides into a metal cylinder (the scanner). The confined space may produce anxiety in some patients, and patients can talk to the technician at all times during the procedure. Earplugs are provided to muffle loud knocking and pulsing noises that occur while the scanner is taking pictures. During the study, the contrast material gadolinium may be injected into an arm vein. Gadolinium \"brightens\" the pictures, producing better images of brain blood flow. Patients will be contacted by telephone 30 days after the procedure to follow how they are doing and learn whether any complications resulted from the angioplasty. \n",
      " Recently cervico-cranial angioplasty and stenting (CCAS) has been introduced as alternative treatment for occlusive disease of the extracranial and the intracranial vessels. Temporary or permanent clinically detectable neurological deficits occur in up to 13% of all patients undergoing CASS and are usually related to distal embolization or hemodynamic insufficiency. Silent cerebral micro-emboli are known to occur in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy and angioplasty but are believed to be of little clinical significance. Distal embolization may be a technical concern when performing CCAS and could cause silent cerebral ischemia. High resolution diffusion-weighted MRI may detect silent hyperacute ischemic lesions in patients undergoing CCAS and examination by a stroke neurologist may detect clinical deficits otherwise unrecognized. \n",

      " This study will examine the relationship between bacterial products in lung infections in cystic fibrosis and disease severity. It will examine plasma and lung tissue from cystic fibrosis patients. Patients with cystic fibrosis and having certain genetic characteristics, who are between 9 and 65 years of age and any cystic fibrosis patient undergoing lung transplantation at INOVA Fairfax Hospital in Fairfax, Virginia, may be eligible for this study. Patients who cannot undergo apheresis may be asked to provide up to an additional 100 cc (7 tablespoons) of blood for research to look at bacterial products. Lung specimens of participating transplant patients will be collected at INOVA Fairfax Hospital. Patients who participate in the apheresis portion of the study will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for 2 to 3 days. Apheresis is a procedure for collecting large quantities of specific blood components. For this study, plasma-the liquid part of the blood-will be collected. For the procedure, whole blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein, similar to donating blood. The blood is separated into its components by centrifugation (spinning), the plasma and white cells are extracted and collected in a bag, and the red cells are returned to the body, either through the same needle or through another needle in the other arm. During the hospital stay, patients may also be asked to participate in other cystic fibrosis studies involving blood tests, an echocardiogram (ultrasound test of the heart), urine pregnancy test, and pulmonary function (breathing) tests. \n",
      " Lungs of individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) are frequently colonized with a number of bacterial pathogens. One of the most common organisms is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Previous studies have shown the presence of the type III-secretion pathway within P. aeruginosa, implicating these cytotoxins as virulence factors for this organism. To evaluate further the effect of these cytotoxins on lung cells, we would like to collect plasma and tissue from individuals with CF. Because larger quantities of plasma than can safely be obtained by simple phlebotomy will be required, apheresis procedures performed in the Clinical Center Apheresis Unit will be used. To obtain lung cells from patients with CF infected with P. aeruginosa, tissue from explanted lungs will be collected in collaboration with INOVA Fairfax Hospital. We intend to look for expression of the type- III proteins of P. aeruginosa by measuring the immune response against components of the type- III pathway and their presence in lung cells. \n",

      "Title = Pilot Study of Levetiracetam (Keppra® (Registered Trademark)) for Bipolar Illness.\n",
      " This study will explore the possible effectiveness of levetiracetam in patients with bipolar illness who have not responded adequately to standard treatments. Levetiracetam was recently approved to treat seizures. Other drugs in the same class as levetiracetam, including carbamazepine and valproate, are widely recognized as substitute medications for lithium or are used as an adjunct to it, and other anticonvulsants have also shown promise in improving bipolar symptoms. Patients with bipolar illness whose manic, depressed or unstable moods are not adequately controlled by their current treatment and who have not responded previously to two standard treatments (i.e., lithium, valproate, carbamazepine or neuroleptics) may be eligible for this study. Participants will take levetiracetam starting at 500 mg daily. If this dose is well tolerated, it will be increased to 500 mg twice a day. Every 3 days, doses may be increased until the target dose of 3000 mg/day is reached. Higher doses, not to exceed 4000 mg/day, may be tried in patients who do not respond fully to the lower doses. Patients and observers will use standard ratings to evaluate the patients' response to therapy during the 8-week study. If, after 8 weeks, the results appear promising, patients may continue treatment for an additional 6 months to evaluate longer-term effects. \n",
      " Almost all of the approved anticonvulsant compounds (with the exception of gabapentin and tiagabine) have now been suggested to have acute antimanic or more long-term mood stabilizing properties. Carbamazepine and valproate have gained a widely recognized role in treatment algorithms of bipolar illness, and lamotrigine has shown promising antidepressant effects. Levetiracetam (Keppra® (Registered Trademark)) is the most recently approved anti-epileptic drug available, and deserves pilot exploration in bipolar illness for a variety of reasons. These include: its positive side-effects profile; it is a derivative of the nootropic agent piracetam which has memory-enhancing properties in animal studies; it likely has a unique mechanism of action since it is not active on most of the traditional excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter systems; it is not active on traditional anticonvulsant models such as pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) or maximum electroshock (MES) seizures, but is able to stop both the development and completed phase of amygdala-kindled seizures; and it is not metabolized by hepatic enzymes and thus has few adverse pharmacokinetic interactions. We propose pilot exploration of levetiracetam as an adjunctive agent in patients with bipolar illness who are inadequately responsive to routine psychopharmacological agents for bipolar illness. At the NIMH we will study a maximum of 10 acutely depressed, 10 manic, and 10 cycling patients enrolled in Protocol 97-M-0039. We would start at Levetiracetam doses of 500 mg/day, and not to exceed 4000 mg/day. Response will be based primarily on the percentage of patients showing \"much\" or \"very much\" improvement on the GCI-BP score in each of the three groups as augmented by the percentage decrement on cross-sectional scales such as the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS) and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) in conjunction with prospective ratings on the NIMH-LCMp. Should preliminary evidence of efficacy be observed in this open add-on clinical trial, more systematic controlled studies will then be designed for confirmation of promising target areas of efficacy. \n",

      "Title = The Natural History and Pathogenesis of Mucolipidosis Type IV.\n",
      " Mucolipidosis Type IV (ML-IV) is a metabolic disorder that causes mental and motor retardation as well as visual impairment. There is storage of material in practically all the cells of the body, causing problems in the brain and the eyes. The disease is caused by a defect in a gene that makes a protein called mucolipin. Patients with ML-IV do not make enough normal mucolipin. More than 80 patients have been diagnosed, most of whom are Ashkenazi Jews. The disease often appears in the first year of life as either delayed motor development or corneal clouding. There are conflicting reports concerning the progressive nature of the disease. Some patients have clear deterioration, while others seem to stay at the same level of the disease for a long time. This study may lead to a better understanding of the disease, the medical difficulties of patients, and better ways of diagnosing ML-IV. Patients with a definite diagnosis of this disease, as well as those patients who need confirmation of the disease, are candidates for this study. Patients will be admitted annually to the Clinical Center for a maximum of five days. A history will be taken and a physical exam done. Blood and urine tests will be done along with brain wave recording, complete eye examination, psychological tests, and speech and language and rehabilitation evaluations. A maximum of 3 mL/kg of blood will be drawn from children and a total of 60 mL from adults. Various eye tests will also be done, some under sedation. DNA will be extracted for possible use in other studies. A skin biopsy will be taken on the first visit. There is a possibility of improved medical management and rehabilitative treatment as a result of participating in this study. \n",
      " The purpose of this protocol is to study patients with various neurometabolic disorders. Mucolipidosis type IV (ML-IV), is a developmental and degenerative disease caused by mutations in the MCOLN1 gene leading to an absent or dysfunctional protein called mucolipin. The goal of this protocol is to assess the neurological and medical status of these patients and characterize the clinical and laboratory abnormalities in order to determine the natural history of the disease. Patients will be followed at least yearly with comprehensive clinical, neurological and ophthalmological examinations combined with neuropsychological, blood, urine and radiological tests. \n",

      "Title = Study of Air Stream in Voice Production.\n",
      " This study will investigate and compare the air stream during voice production in patients with abductor spasmodic dysphonia and in normal volunteers. People with abductor spasmodic dysphonia have uncontrolled muscle spasms during speech, resulting in a weak voice. A better understanding of the abnormalities of this disorder may help in the development of more effective treatments. Healthy volunteers and patients with abductor spasmodic dysphonia may be eligible for this study. Candidates will have a physical examination and medical history. (Patients will be videotaped and voice-recorded during the medical interview for review by specialists who will identify the type and severity of their speech disorder.) All candidates will also undergo a procedure called flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy to record the movement of the vocal folds during speech, breathing and other tasks such as singing, whistling and prolonging vowels. For this test, the inside of the nose is sprayed with an anesthetic (lidocaine) to numb the nasal cavity and a decongestant (oxymetazoline) to widen the nasal passage. Then, a thin flexible tube called a nasolaryngoscope is passed through the nose to the larynx (voice box). A camera attached to the eyepiece of the nasolaryngoscope records the movements of the vocal folds. Participants will then have an airway interruption test to detect pressure changes in the voice box during production of continuous sounds. A nose clip is placed over the subject's nose and two sensor devices are placed on the neck to pick up changes in movement and position of the vocal cords during voicing. A mouthpiece is placed in the mouth, and subjects are asked to say \"ah\" continuously at a specified sound level. This voicing is repeated 33 times with periodic breaks. Patients only will also be given an injection of botulinum toxin. These injections are effective, in varying degrees, in about 60 percent of patients with abductor spasmodic dysphonia. This study will use a different approach to botulinum toxin injections to test their effect in patients with pressures higher than normal. Rather than inject the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle or the cricothyroid muscle, as is typically done, the thyroarytenoid muscle, which closes the voice box, will be injected on one side. A second one-sided injection may be given after 2 or 3 weeks if no effect is seen after the first injection. Speech will be recorded at each visit to measure any change in symptoms after the injection. \n",
      " Persons with abductor spasmodic dysphonia (ABSD) have difficulties with phonation onset after voiceless consonants resulting in breathy breaks. Previously, ABSD was thought to involve heightened activity of the laryngeal abductor muscle, the posterior cricoarytenoid. Botulinum toxin injection of the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle in this disorder, however, only provides a partial benefit in about 50% of persons with ABSD. An electromyographic study of the laryngeal muscles in ABSD found asymmetries in the adductor muscle (the thyroarytenoid muscle) in ABSD. Thyroarytenoid (TA) activation levels differed between the two sides in persons with ABSD. An electromyographic study of the laryngeal muscles in ABSD found asymmetries in the adductor muscle (the thyroarytenoid muscle) in ABSD. Thyroarytenoid (TA) activation levels differed between the two sides in persons with ABSD in comparison with controls; the right TA showed greater activity than the left. This suggested that ABSD might involve increased tone on one side of the larynx, and that treatment should address any such asymmetry in muscle tone. We hypothesize that if TA muscle activity was greater on one side in ABSD, then A) phonation threshold pressures should be greater than normal in persons with ABSD, and B) that treatment with botulinum toxin in those with phonation threshold pressures greater than normal should show symptom reduction following injection of the TA muscles on one side. Both normal volunteers and persons with ABSD will be studied. Phonation Threshold Pressure (PTP) will be measured using the brief interruption of supraglottal airflow with a valve during phonation into a tube. The electroglottographic signals will be used to determine when vocal fold vibration ceases after the valve closes. The PTP will be measured as the difference between an estimate of the subglottal pressure achieved after phonation offset following valve closure, and the minimum subglottal vocal tract pressure at the point just before vocal fold vibration ceases following the interruption of airflow. Persons with ABSD who have higher phonation threshold pressures than normal will then receive an injection with botulinum toxin injection into the thyroarytenoid muscle on one side based on movement asymmetries observed on fiberoptic nasolaryngoscopy. Blinded measures of symptom frequency made before and after treatment will determine if symptoms are improved. \n",

      "Title = Safety Study of Idebenone to Treat Friedreich's Ataxia.\n",
      " This study will determine the highest dose of idebonone that can safely be given to patients with Friedrich's ataxia, an inherited degenerative disease that causes loss of muscle coordination, speech problems, weakness and sensory loss. Enlargement of the left ventricle (the large pumping chamber of the heart) is also common in this disease. In studies in France and Canada, patients with Friedrich's ataxia who were given idebonone, an antioxidant similar to the dietary supplement coenzyme Q, had a decrease in the size of their left ventricle. Patients 5 years and older with Friedrich's ataxia may be eligible for this study. Pregnant and lactating women may not participate. Candidates will be screened with a medical history and physical examination and a review of genetic studies. Patients who have not had genetic studies will be offered genetic counseling and testing to confirm or rule out Friedrich's ataxia. Participants will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for 3 days. They will have blood and urine tests and a heart evaluation, including an echocardiogram-a procedure that uses sound waves to produce images of the heart, and an electrocardiogram-a study of the electrical activity of the heart. When these tests have been completed, patients will take an idebonone capsule. They will be monitored for side effects for 72 hours. Blood samples will be collected through an intravenous catheter (flexible plastic tube placed in a vein) 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours after the drug is taken to determine how long it takes for the drug to be eliminated from the body. Patients will return for a follow-up visit within 1 to 8 weeks. Those who experienced no serious side effects may receive another, higher dose of the drug, with at least 6 days between doses. \n",
      " Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is a progressive, autosomal recessive, multisystem degenerative disease for which there is currently no effective treatment. Recent studies suggest that lipid-soluble antioxidants may prevent the progression of neurodegeneration and lead to some reversal of cardiomyopathy. This will be a phase Ia, unblinded, dose-escalation trial examining the toxicity and tolerability of the antioxidant idebenone in patients with FRDA. Our primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated single dose of idebenone in patients with FRDA. Our secondary objective is to document the pharmacokinetics of single-dose idebenone in this population. We aim to enroll 48 patients divided evenly among three age cohorts: children (ages 5-11), adolescents (ages 12-17), and adults (age greater than or equal to 18). Each age cohort will be studied independently. Three patients from each cohort will receive one day of oral idebenone followed by inpatient monitoring for 72 hours. If dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is not observed during the 72-hour study period, three new patients will receive the next highest dose. If one of three patients experiences DLT, three new patients will receive the same dose. Within each cohort, the dose will be escalated until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is established. The MTD will be defined as one dose below that which resulted in DLT in any two patients within a cohort. Subsequent to the completion of this phase Ia trial, we plan to further refine the MTD for each age group in a phase Ib trial in which we will examine multiple-dose regimens over a longer study period. We hope to follow these phase I studies with a double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase II trial to further evaluate safety and to estimate the efficacy of idebenone using cardiac parameters as our primary endpoints. In addition, we are currently in the process of validating a clinical evaluation scale for FRDA that we hope to employ in measuring neurological parameters as a secondary endpoint in the phase II trial. \n",

At least 2 weeks after the completion of the last course of chemotherapy, patients receive maintenance therapy. Patients with a good response to initial therapy with prednisone receive maintenance therapy comprising oral dexamethasone three times daily on weeks 1 and 2; vincristine IV on day 2 of weeks 1 and 2; oral mercaptopurine daily on weeks 1-14; and oral methotrexate once weekly on weeks 1-14. Patients with a poor response to initial therapy with prednisone receive maintenance therapy comprising oral mercaptopurine daily for weeks 1-14; oral methotrexate once weekly for weeks 1-14; oral dexamethasone three times daily for weeks 1 and 2; vincristine IV on day 2 of weeks 1 and 2; etoposide IV over 2 hours once weekly on weeks 8 and 9; and cytarabine IV over 1 hour once weekly on weeks 8 and 9. Treatment repeats in both maintenance therapy regimens every 14 weeks for a total of 3 courses. Patients also receive methotrexate IT on day 1 of the first and third course of therapy and cytarabine IT on day 1 of the second course of therapy. Patients receive prednisolone IT in combination with any dose of intrathecal chemotherapy. Beginning after the completion of maintenance therapy, all patients receive continuing maintenance therapy comprising oral mercaptopurine daily and oral methotrexate once a week.

      " Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus monoclonal antibody therapy in treating patients who have metastatic prostate cancer that has not responded to previous hormone therapy. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies such as bevacizumab may stop the growth of cancer cells by stopping blood flow to the tumor. Combining monoclonal antibody therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. \n",
      " PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine time to objective progression, response rate (objective and PSA response) and duration of response in men with hormone refractory prostate cancer treated with estramustine, docetaxel and bevacizumab. II. To determine the toxicity of this regimen in men with hormone refractory prostate cancer. III. To study the relationship of baseline VEGF levels in urine and plasma and changes in these levels to response and duration of response to treatment with bevacizumab, docetaxel and estramustine. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral estramustine 3 times daily on days 1-5 and docetaxel IV over 1 hour followed by bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 2.

      " Hearing loss and loss of vision can be very harmful to the well-being and life of people who suffer from them. Usher syndrome is the name of a disease where people have both hearing loss and visual loss. In fact more than half of people who are deaf and blind have Usher syndrome. In this study we are trying to find the causes of all types of Usher syndrome and to learn more about how the eyes and ears work. Usher syndrome is caused by changes in our genes that lead to mistakes in the functioning of our eyes and ears. We may conduct hearing tests called audiograms to test hearing and a vision test called an electroretinogram (ERG) to test how well the retina (the part of your eye that senses light) is working on participants in the study. From these tests we can tell what kind of Usher syndrome a participant may have. We will then get DNA from participants by drawing blood. The DNA will be studied, along with DNA from members of the participant's family and other families, to try to find the gene that is causing Usher syndrome in the participant. Once the gene is found we will be able to study it to learn more about how the eyes and ears work. If a subject has already been diagnosed we may just need copies of their medical records and blood can be drawn locally. In order to increase the power of the study and the likelihood of detecting relevant genes participants will be taken from the Ashkenazi Jewish population group only. This will make it much easier to find the genes. \n",

      " This study will examine differences in how the brain processes English and Korean in native Korean speakers who are fluent and non-fluent in English as a second language. It is thought that people who are non-fluent in a second language process the second language differently from their native language-using different areas of the brain and requiring additional working memory. The study will increase understanding of language acquisition, brain plasticity and bilingualism. Native Korean speakers between 18 and 50 years of age with English as a second language may be eligible for this study. Three groups of individuals will be enrolled: 1) less fluent bilinguals - those who have lived in the United States for at least 1, but less than 2 years and studied English after age 12 and who have a TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) score above 550; 2) fluent bilinguals with early acquisition - those who were exposed to English before age 7 and lived in the United States after that; and 3) fluent bilinguals with late acquisition - those who were exposed to English after age 12 and lived in the United States after age 10. People with a history of head injury or neurological or thought disorder, left-handed people, and people who cannot read the material used in the study will be excluded from the study. Participants will undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning while reading words in English or Korean; while translating from one language to the other; and while answering questions about the meaning of words in each language. MRI uses a strong magnetic field to image brain tissue. The patient lies on a table that slides into a narrow metal cylinder, which is the scanner. The head is restrained gently with foam padding to limit movement. The patient can see out of the scanner through a mirror and is in contact with the technician via an intercom at all times during the procedure. The scans measures blood flow to different parts of the brain, providing information about what brain regions are being used during the tasks performed. Another scan will be done to obtain a detailed picture of the brain's structure. This study will evaluate the usefulness of MRI in identifying brain areas involved in processing different languages and increase knowledge about how illness affects brain function. It may help plan treatment for bilingual patients who must undergo brain surgery for uncontrolled epilepsy or who have a neurological disorder affecting different languages with varying degrees. \n",
      " This protocol will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the localization of verbal working memory and translation systems in normal volunteers who speak English as a second language. Several important issues in areas such as language acquisition, cortical plasticity, and bilingualism will be advanced by an increased understanding of how multiple languages are represented in the brain. There are also an increasing number of bilingual patients who need to undergo surgical intervention, particularly for uncontrolled epilepsy, or suffer from a variety of neurological disorders affecting different languages to varying degrees. It is very important to accurately assess and localize language functions in these patients. This study will identify cortical areas activated by the immediate translation of words and sentences between native and second languages, as well as differences in verbal working memory systems between two languages. It will also evaluate differences in verbal working memory and translation systems among subjects with different proficiency and different age at acquisition of their second language. This study will advance our understanding of the cortical representation that underlies multiple language functions. \n",

      "Title = Bevacizumab to Treat Inflammatory Breast Cancer or Locally Advanced Breast Cancer.\n",
      " This study will evaluate the effectiveness of the drug bevacizumab, in combination with doxorubicin and docetaxel, in improving survival of patients with inflammatory breast cancer or locally advanced breast cancer. Inflammatory breast cancer is an aggressive form of locally advanced breast cancer that often causes a red, swollen, tender breast and is associated with a poor prognosis. Bevacizumab blocks the growth of new blood vessels that supply oxygen and nutrients to tumors, and therefore, may kill cancer cells or stop their growth. Doxorubicin and docetaxel are approved drugs for treating breast cancer. Patients 18 years of age or older with stage inflammatory breast cancer who have not been treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination, blood and urine tests, chest x-ray, electrocardiogram, and MUGA scan or echocardiography (see below). A mammogram of both breasts, dynamic MRI imaging of the affected breast, computed tomography (CT) of the head, chest, abdomen and pelvis, and a bone scan are done to determine the extent of disease. Participants undergo the following procedures at various intervals before, during and/or after completing chemotherapy: Tumor and skin biopsies to study the effects of bevacizumab on tumor blood vessels, tumor growth, and the biology of inflammatory breast cancer. A small piece of tumor tissue and a small piece of skin from the affected breast are removed under local anesthesia for microscopic study. Dynamic MRI to examine changes in the blood vessels and breast cancer following bevacizumab treatment. This test involves injecting a contrast liquid into a vein before scanning. A standard MRI scan is done before the dynamic MRI. Blood tests are done to 1) study clot formation and breakdown, 2) measure levels of VEGF (a substance produced by breast cancer cells) and VCAM-1 (a substance produced by cells lining blood vessel walls), and 3) check blood counts and liver and kidney function. MUGA (a nuclear medicine scan that checks the heart's pumping ability) or echocardiogram (ultrasound scan of the heart to evaluate heart function. Blood pressure monitoring Urine tests CT scans and x-rays to evaluate disease before and after treatment. Patients will have a central venous line (plastic tube) placed into a major vein in the chest before beginning treatment. The line stays in the body during the entire treatment period and is used to give chemotherapy and other medications, if needed, and to draw blood samples. All treatment is given on a single day every 3 weeks. This constitutes one treatment cycle. Cycle 1 consists of bevacizumab alone; cycles 2 through 7 consist of bevacizumab with doxorubicin and docetaxel. During each cycle, patients also receive injections under the skin of G-CSF, a drug that raises the number of infection-fighting white blood cells, which are often decreased as a side effect of chemotherapy. After cycle 7, patients may require surgery and radiation or radiation alone. After radiation treatment, bevacizumab is re-started, given alone every 3 weeks for an additional eight cycles. Patients whose tumors are positive for estrogen or progesterone receptors will be advised to take the drug tamoxifen or anastrozole for 5 years to decrease the chances of disease recurrence. This would begin with cycle 8. \n",
      " This is a pilot study in patients with previously untreated inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) or locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) to evaluate angiogenesis parameters after treatment with rhuMAb VEGF - recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody vascular endothelial growth factor (bevacizumab). The challenge for new molecular-targeted anti-angiogenesis therapy is to devise appropriate and reliable markers to monitor efficacy. This may be achieved directly by evaluating changes in angiogenesis parameters in tumor samples. The use of less invasive surrogate markers to assess the efficacy of anti-angiogenic therapy is preferable. This may include functional changes in tumor vasculature assessed using non-invasive methods such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or determination of changes in circulating soluble markers of angiogenesis. Most breast cancers over express VEGF thus making it an ideal disease for treatment with anti-angiogenesis therapy. This study will evaluate the effects of bevacizumab on angiogenesis parameters both molecular and functional. The first cycle will consist of bevacizumab alone followed by six cycles of bevacizumab in combination with doxorubicin and docetaxel (AT). Loco-regional therapy will follow and bevacizumab will be recommenced for eight cycles. Changes in pre-designated angiogenesis parameters will be assessed at baseline, three weeks after bevacizumab and after three cycles of AT/bevacizumab. The first three molecular parameters: endothelial cell proliferation, endothelial cell apoptosis and tissue VEGF require multiple tumor core biopsies obtained using a mammotome. The fourth parameter k(ep), the redistribution constant is obtained using dynamic MRI. To determine the variability of the values of the three molecular primary angiogenesis parameters, multiple biopsies will be sampled at the same time points. An attempt will be made to correlate each of the four primary angiogenesis parameters with time to progression/recurrence. The effects of bevacizumab alone and AT/bevacizumab directly on tumor vasculature using dynamic MRI imaging and on the circulating angiogenesis marker, serum vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) at the same three time points and prior to surgery and will be undertaken in an exploratory manner. An attempt will be made to correlate changes in these parameters with clinical findings and changes in tissue angiogenesis parameters. Additionally, other angiogenesis biomarkers will also be studied in an exploratory manner. Thrombosis factors will be monitored given the increased incidence of venous and arterial thrombosis seen in previous clinical trials using bevacizumab. An increase in the incidence of hypertension has also been seen. A subset of patients in this study will undergo frequent blood pressure monitoring to obtain a profile of the effect of bevacizumab on blood pressure. \n",

      "Title = Cause and Pathogenesis of Neurometabolic Disorders.\n",
      " This study will examine the origin and development of certain neurological diseases involving abnormal metabolism. A significant number of patients with progressive neurological disorders have not been diagnosed despite extensive workups. Lack of a specific diagnosis may amplify the distress of both the patient and family and decrease the chance of obtaining effective therapy. This study will try to advance the diagnosis and management of such patients. Patients with a metabolic neurological disease of unknown cause or one which presents an unusual or difficult management problem may be eligible for this study. This study does not include patients with known or suspected leukodystrophy. Participants will undergo various procedures, including physical and neurologic examinations, blood and urine tests, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine the extent and severity of disease. MRI scanning uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to show structural and chemical changes in the brain. During the procedure, the patient lies on a table in a narrow cylinder containing a magnetic field. He or she can speak with a staff member via an intercom system at all times during the procedure. Patients will also have a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to examine the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which bathes the brain and spinal cord. To obtain the fluid, a local anesthetic is administered and a needle is inserted in the space between the bones in the lower back where the CSF circulates below the spinal cord. A small amount of fluid is collected through the needle. Although spinal fluid will not be examined regularly, this test may be requested during some clinic visits. X-rays, nuclear medicine scans and consultations may be obtained as needed. Other tests may include electroencephalograms (brain wave recordings), psychological tests, and speech and language and rehabilitation evaluations. A skin biopsy may be done to grow cells in culture for metabolic and genetic testing and to analyze the skin under a microscope. For the biopsy, an area of skin is numbed with an anesthetic and a small circular area is removed, using a sharp cookie cutter-type instrument. First degree relatives (parents, children or siblings) of patients with a metabolic disorder of unknown cause will be asked to provide a blood sample for DNA studies to try to identify genetic basis of the disorder. The study is expected to continue for 3 years, with yearly monitoring of patients for changes in neurological, ophthalmological and general medical status. \n",
      " On this protocol we will see patients of all ages with a neurodegenerative disorder of unknown etiology, as well patients with known diseases that are atypical or present difficult management problems. Patients with a known or a suspected leukodystrophy will be excluded from this study. Lack of specific diagnosis amplifies the distress felt by patients and families and decreases the chance of effective therapy. Clinical and laboratory evaluation will include blood, urine, spinal fluid, peripheral tissue pathology and radiological studies. \n",

      " The purpose of this study is to look at the level of depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA or Depo-Provera) in the blood to see if is affected by certain anti-HIV drugs (nelfinavir [NFV], efavirenz [EFV], indinavir [IDV] in combination with ritonavir [RTV], and nevirapine [NVP]). This study will also look at the levels of these anti-HIV drugs to see if they are affected by DMPA. DMPA is a hormonal birth control method that is given as an injection. It is not known if taking DMPA together with anti-HIV drugs changes the amount of DMPA and/or the amount of anti-HIV drugs in the blood. If higher levels of DMPA occur, side effects may increase. If lower levels of anti-HIV drugs occur, the drugs may become less effective against HIV. This study will look at the levels of anti-HIV drugs and DMPA in the blood when these medications are used together. \n",
      " DMPA, an injectable depot formulation of medroxyprogesterone (MPA), is a commonly used form of \"progestin-only\" contraception. Information is limited on the specific P450 isozymes that metabolize MPA; however, it appears that CYP3A4 is 1 pathway of hepatic clearance. Drugs known to be inhibitors of the CYP3A4 pathway (such as protease inhibitors [PIs]) may lead to elevated concentrations of MPA. Secondly, MPA given as DMPA injections has been shown to induce the activity of CYP3A4 by 25 percent. It is possible that this action may result in enhanced clearance of the substrates of CYP3A4, including PIs and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), which in turn may result in reduced drug exposure and possible ARV failure. This study is designed to address the lack of information on potential interactions between PIs or NNRTIs and DMPA. Patients are enrolled into 1 of 5 arms based on their current ARV regimen: Arm A (control group): No current ARVs or receiving nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) only. Arm B: NFV (1250 mg bid or 750 mg tid) in combination with NRTIs. Arm C: EFV (600 mg qd) in combination with NRTIs. Arm D: IDV (800 mg bid) and RTV (100 mg bid or 200 mg bid) in combination with NRTIs. Arm E: NVP (200 mg bid) in combination with NRTIs. Acceptable NRTIs and any fixed combination of these medications include: zidovudine (ZDV), lamivudine, didanosine, stavudine (d4T), zalcitabine, and abacavir; concurrent therapy using ZDV and d4T is not allowed. ARV therapy is not provided by this study. One dose of DMPA is provided to all patients at entry (Day 0) and an optional dose of DMPA will be available at the final visit (Week 12) for those who are interested in continuing with DMPA outside of the protocol and who do not experience adverse events from the first DMPA injection. Patients in Arms B, C, D, and E have intensive pharmacokinetic sampling done at entry and at Week 4 to measure ARV levels. All patients have blood tests at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 to measure levels of DMPA and progesterone. In addition, tests to monitor HIV-1 RNA levels, CD4 and CD8 counts, hematology, blood chemistries, and liver function are performed periodically. \n",

      "Title = Linkage Study in Familial Pulmonary Fibrosis.\n",
      " To map the gene (or genes) for familial pulmonary fibrosis. \n",
      " BACKGROUND: Familial pulmonary fibrosis (FPF) is a rare, progressive, life-threatening disease. Although far from definitive, several lines of evidence suggest that it could involve genetic susceptibility and that its expression may be modified gene-environment interactions involving exposure to fibrogenic dusts. If the specific gene loci involved can be identified and their functions characterized, these studies could lead to a better understanding of the etiology of the disease and effective intervention strategies among families at increased risk. It is conceivable that the genetically influenced pathologic mechanisms involved may be shared with other, more common forms of pulmonary fibrosis such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) or asbestosis. Thus, these studies could lead to the early identification of individuals susceptible to reversible interstitial lung disease and to the development of novel therapeutic approaches. Familial pulmonary fibrosis is indistinguishable pathologically from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and appears to be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with variable penetrance; pulmonary fibrosis is associated with pleiotropic genetic disorders, such as Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, Neimann-Pick disease, Gaucher's disease, and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia; pulmonary fibrosis is frequently observed in autoimmune disease, including rheumatoid arthritis and systemic sclerosis; variable susceptibility is evident among workers who are reported to be exposed occupationally to similar concentrations of fibrogenic dusts; and inbred strains of mice differ in their susceptibility to fibrogenic dust. DESIGN NARRATIVE: The study uses standard genetic methodology (linkage analysis) to investigate the distribution of polymorphisms for anonymous genetic markers in families with familial pulmonary fibrosis. The comprehensive genome-wide study, using standard genetic markers, will allow identification of loci which subsequently may prove to contain novel genes that play a role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. Once genetic loci are defined in familial pulmonary fibrosis, candidate genes can be identified on the basis of both positional and functional criteria. Moreover, this approach will provide basic information on high priority loci that will be applicable to the rapidly evolving dense human transcript map for pulmonary fibrosis in families with two or more cases of pulmonary fibrosis. The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the \"End Date\" entered in the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record. \n",

      " This study will help to determine the effectiveness of glutamine and creatine as a possible therapy for DMD. Boys with DMD who are enrolled in this trial will be randomly chosen to receive creatine monohydrate or glutamine or an inactive placebo orally for six months. Once a month during the six-month treatment period, the study participants will have their muscle strength evaluated using manual and computerized testing methods. This study will be conducted at several CINRG Centers throughout the U.S., Belgium, Israel and Puerto Rico. This study is supported by the Muscular Dystrophy Association. \n",
      " PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The purpose of this study is to see if children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) who are given glutamine (a nutritional supplement) or creatine monohydrate (a nutritional supplement) have changes in strength compared to children who are given no medicinal treatment. Children who are chosen to be in this research study will be diagnosed with DMD, be between the ages of 5 and 10 years old, and will not have participated in any other DMD clinical trials within the last year, and will not have been on medications that disqualify them from participation in this trial. All children in this clinical trial are entered at the discretion of the doctors in charge of the study. During the first and second visits, children who fulfill the criteria for participation in the clinical trial will be determined. We expect 50 subjects to participate at CINRG centers worldwide. PROCEDURES Children will be randomized (a procedure like flipping a coin) into one of three groups: treated with glutamine, treated with creatine monohydrate, or untreated (placebo: a sugar pill with no medication). Neither parents, children, nor the doctors treating the children will know the group each child has been assigned to. Because of the study design, there is a possibility that children will receive no treatment (placebo group) during the clinical trial. During the trial children must take one supplement mixed with water in the morning and supplements mixed with water each night. Nine (9) clinic visits are required to complete this clinical trial. During visits to the clinic, each child will be evaluated by members of the research team to determine the child?s strength. Strength will be measured in different ways: manual testing, quantitative testing, and the usual measures used during visits to the neurologist (child will be asked to rise from the floor, walk across room, etc.). Manual testing is the way strength is usually measured by your child?s doctor. The quantitative muscle strength test (QMT) is a mechanical way to measure strength: the child sits/lays on an examining table and is asked to pull/push a strap. This test will determine the strength of different muscle groups in kilograms of force. An electrocardiogram (ECG, a heart test) will be performed during screening visit 2 and month 6 and blood (a small amount equal to about 2 to 3 tablespoons) will be drawn on screening visit 2 and months 1, 3 and 6. Urine tests will be done at screening visit 2 nd months 1, 3 and 6 to monitor kidney function. \n",

      "Title = Clinical Trial of Propranolol for Seasonal Affective Disorder.\n",
      " The purpose of this study is to determine what dose of a new timed-release tablet of the drug propranolol will reduce secretion of the hormone melatonin in healthy volunteers. This study will also determine whether suppressing melatonin will improve depressive symptoms in people with seasonal affective disorder (SAD). SAD (sometimes referred to as winter depression) is a condition in which people experience depression as a result of seasonal variations in light. Human brains have a circadian pacemaker that regulates many body functions. As the seasons change and light duration varies, the circadian pacemaker regulates seasonal behavior by transmitting a signal of day length to the pineal gland, which secretes the hormone melatonin. Melatonin secretion increases in the winter as the duration of light decreases. Evidence suggests that the melatonin signal of seasonal change is present in people with SAD but not in healthy volunteers; thus there is a possibility that seasonal changes which influence the duration of melatonin secretion control the course of illness in individuals with SAD. This study will determine whether propranolol can shorten the duration of melatonin secretion and mimic the effect of summer days to improve symptoms of depression in people with SAD. Healthy volunteers will be admitted to the hospital for about 2 days. The volunteers will receive either propranolol or placebo (an inactive pill) before going to bed and upon awakening. Blood samples will be collected at various times throughout the study. Participants with SAD will be interviewed periodically on an outpatient basis to determine the onset of depression in the fall or winter. Two weeks after depressive symptoms arise, participants will begin treatment with either propranolol or placebo. At the beginning of the treatment, participants will be hospitalized for about 2 days and will have blood collected at various times. During the hospital stay, participants will continue treatment with either propranolol or placebo in the morning and at night; all participants will receive propranolol at some point during the study. Participants will be interviewed weekly for 4 weeks. Premenopausal women with or without SAD will keep a record of their menstrual cycles and will use a urine test kit to identify the time of ovulation during the month before and after admission to the hospital. \n",
      " Symptoms of seasonal affective disorder (SAD) in humans resemble seasonal changes that occur in animals. Moreover, in both humans and animals, the occurrence of these changes is regulated by light. In animals the circadian pacemaker regulates seasonal behavior by transmitting a signal of daylength to other sites in the organism. This signal is expressed, reciprocally, in the duration of nocturnal melatonin secretion, which is longer in winter and shorter in summer. Sites distal to the pineal that regulate seasonal behavior read and respond to this melatonin signal of change of season. In a longitudinal study, we showed that a homologous melatonin signal of change of season is present in patients with SAD but not in healthy volunteers. In light of the animal models, this finding raises the possibility that seasonal changes in duration of melatonin secretion govern the course of illness in patients with SAD. If so, then an intervention that shortens the duration of melatonin secretion in winter and thereby mimics the effect of summer days should improve symptoms of winter depression. To test this hypothesis, we propose to administer propranolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor blocking medication that is frequently prescribed for the treatment of hypertension, to patients with SAD in the winter. We will administer propranolol at a time of night when it would suppress and shorten the duration of melatonin secretion and then ascertain whether this intervention improves depression. A unique feature of this parallel-design, controlled clinical trial is that propranolol, when administered at a time of day when melatonin is not secreted, can serve as its own active placebo. \n",

      "Title = 1-Octanol to Treat Essential Tremor.\n",
      " This study will determine the optimal dose of 1-octanol that will safely reduce tremors in patients with essential tremor-a disorder in which the hands, and sometimes the head, shake involuntarily. Current treatments may be ineffective or produce unwanted side effects. Ethanol (the chemical in beer and wine that causes intoxication) reduces tremor in many patients, but patients generally don't use it regularly because it interferes with daily activities. Laboratory studies show that 1-octanol, a drug that is similar to ethanol, may have the same beneficial effect on tremors with less likelihood of intoxication. Patients 21 years of age and older with essential tremor may be eligible for this 10-day study. Candidates will be evaluated with a neurological examination, blood tests, urinalysis and electrocardiogram (EKG). Those enrolled will be admitted to the hospital for 4 days for 1-octanol administration and monitoring. On day 1, patients will have a medical history and physical examination. A catheter (a thin plastic tube) will be placed in a vein of the forearm for sampling blood. Patients will take one 1-octanol capsule (at one of seven doses) by mouth and will be monitored for tremors and drug side effects. Blood will be sampled periodically in the first 3 hours to determine 1-octanol blood levels. On days 2 and 3, patients will be monitored for additional side effects. On days 3 and 4, laboratory tests (blood and urine) will be done to evaluate liver and kidney function. On day 4, the catheter will be removed and the patient will be discharged from the hospital. A follow-up visit will be scheduled 1 week after discharge for a physical examination and blood, urine and EKG tests. \n",
      " Essential tremor is a very common movement disorder affecting approximately 1.4% of the population. Response to medications such as beta blockers and mysoline may be only partial or be accompanied by intolerable side effects. Roughly 80% of patients have significant tremor reduction to ethanol although daily use of this as a treatment has potentially serious social and legal consequences. The leading hypothesis for the pathophysiology of essential tremor is unmasking of spontaneous oscillation of neurons in the inferior olive. Both ethanol and 1-octanol have been shown to reduce these spontaneous oscillations in an animal model of essential tremor; however, 1-octanol dose this at a dose much lower than an intoxicating dose suggesting that it may be useful in the treatment of essential tremor. Our initial study with 1-octanol at a low, single dose in patients with essential tremor suggested it was both efficacious and safe. This present study is planned to identify a maximum tolerated dose and broaden the safety and efficacy data in humans. Additionally, we hope to collect further information about the pharmacokinetics of 1-octanol. This study is designed as a phase Ia, unblinded, inpatient study of adults with essential tremor receiving escalating doses of 1-octanol. Cohorts of three will begin dose escalation at the dose previously studied. Each cohort will be followed in inpatient setting for 72 hours ( and outpatient for 1 additional week) during which adverse events, pharmacokinetics and efficacy will be assessed. If no subject achieves dose-limiting toxicity, 3 additional subjects will be recruited to receive the next higher dose. If 1/3 subjects achieves dose-limiting toxicity, the next cohort will receive the same dose. Dose limiting toxicity is defined as the dose that produces dose-limiting toxicity in at least 2 subjects. Maximum tolerated dose will be defined as the next lower dose. With this study, we hope to identify a range of doses that may useful in the treatment of essential tremor and combined with the pharmacokinetic and efficacy data, design a protocol to study multiple dose regimens over longer time periods. \n",

      " Treatment of HIV-infected patients involves combining drugs from different classes of anti-HIV drugs. One preferred regimen for adults is 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and 1 protease inhibitor (PI). For children, this regimen may be too complicated or the drugs may be too difficult to take by mouth. The purpose of this study was to determine the long-term safety and effectiveness of daily didanosine (ddI), efavirenz (EFV), and emtricitabine (FTC) in pediatric patients who had taken few or no anti-HIV drugs. \n",
      " Anti-HIV treatment options are limited for pediatric patients because combination therapies recommended for adults may not be appropriate for children or adolescents. Few PIs are available in formulations appropriate for pediatric patients, and complex dosing schedules and food requirements may be detrimental to treatment adherence. A once-daily regimen of the NRTIs ddI and FTC and the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) EFV has been shown safe and well tolerated in adults. This Phase I/II open label study evaluated the long-term safety and efficacy of a ddI, FTC, and EFV regimen in pediatric patients. All study patients were either absolutely naive to antiretroviral therapy or had received less than or equal to 56 days perinatal prophylaxis or less than 7 days of cumulative antiretroviral therapy prior to study entry, and had a plasma screening plasma HIV-1 RNA levels >= 5000 copies/mL. This study was written to characterize the disposition of FTC, determine the PK data for ddI-EC QD, comparing the bio-availability of the enteric coated formulation with ddI pediatric powder for oral solution, and to provide insight into the age related pharmacokinetics differences observed in this and other studies. HIV infected pediatric patients were stratified into three age Groups: Group 1: 90 days to <3 years of age; Group 2: 3 years to 12 years of age (inclusive); and Group 3: 13 to 21 years of age (inclusive). The initial study doses for the triple drug regimen was FTC, 6 mk/kg up to a maximum of 200 mg once daily, for EFV, the dose for age Group 1 was determined in PACTG 382 and dose adjusted for body size, and the doses for age Groups 2 and 3 were defined in the dosing table of the protocol of up to a maximum of 600 mg once daily as a capsule or 720 mg as an oral solution; for ddI, 240 mg/m2 up to a maximum of 400 mg once daily. Comparison of age groups was not required as per the protocol. Patients were followed for a maximum of 192 weeks; all patients were to receive ddI, EFV, and FTC together once daily. Study visits occurred at study entry, Weeks 2,and 4, and every 4 weeks thereafter. Blood collection, medical history assessment, and a physical exam occurred at all visits; urine collection occurred at selected visits. Intensive pharmacokinetic (PK) studies was done at Weeks 2 and 12 to determine if dose adjustments were required for any of the drugs. If virologic failure was determined, PK studies was repeated 4 weeks after adjustments in therapy. Parents or guardians were asked to complete treatment adherence questionnaires at some visits. Some patients were also asked to participate in an additional PK study after Week 16 or week 96. \n",

      " The purpose of this study is to use brain imaging technology to compare how the brains of adolescents and adults are activated during tasks that involve emotional responses. Evidence suggests that adolescents and adults experience activation in similar brain regions when they engage in tasks that involve the processing of emotional stimuli. However, the degree of task-associated activation may differ between adolescents and adults. This study will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare brain activation patterns in adolescents and adults. This study will also be used to develop emotion-evoking fMRI tasks to determine whether there are puberty and age-linked components of brain development. \n",
      " The goal of this project is to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare the degree to which brain regions of adolescents and adults with and without steroid-related endocrine disorders are engaged by tasks involving processing of emotionally salient stimuli. In healthy subjects, based on developmental continuities in the relevant psychological processes, we anticipate considerable similarity across age groups in the topography of brain regions engaged by relevant tasks. However, we hypothesize that developmental differences in cortico-limbic circuits of adolescents and adults will be reflected in patterns of fMRI activation. Specifically, we hypothesize in both adults and adolescents that attention and memory tasks involving the processing of emotionally salient stimuli will engage the amygdala, cingulate gyrus, and association cortex of medial/inferior prefrontal cortex and temporal regions. Nevertheless, height of task-associated activation is hypothesized to differ between adolescents and adults within these regions. Moreover, prior studies distinguish puberty vs. age-related aspects of cognitive development: some aspects of attention or memory development relate to changes in chronological age whereas other aspects, particularly those involving emotional processes, relate to pubertal status. Therefore, we expect eventually to use emotion-evoking fMRI tasks to test hypotheses on the presence of complementary, distinguishable puberty vs. age-related components of brain development. In patients with endocrine disorders, we expect to identify abnormal brain function related to defects in steroidogenesis, including in utero hyperandrogenism and hypocortisolism seen in Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH), congenital male hyperandrogenism seen in familial male precocious puberty (FMPP), and hypercortisolism seen as Cushing's Syndrome (CS). To meet these initial goals, we developed and tested a number of attention/emotion tasks in healthy adults and healthy adolescents, tested systematically a few of these tasks in the fMRI, including a face-emotion processing task, an affective picture- processing task, a threat bias task, a dot-probe task, a reward-related task, and tasks probing social processing. We are now entering the 2nd phase of the protocol, in which we are focusing on endocrine disorders, CAH, FMPP and CS. We hypothesize that both face-emotion processing task, an affective picture- processing task will engage the amygdala, cingulate gyrus, and association cortices of the medial/inferior prefrontal and temporal regions differently as a function of time of occurrence, severity, and type of endocrine abnormalities. \n",

      "Title = Phenylbutyrate/Genistein Duotherapy in Delta F508-Homozygous(for Cystic Fibrosis).\n",
      " We are testing a new combination of medicines, to determine if they could be used to treat cystic fibrosis (CF). Subjects with CF who have two copies of the most common mutation (change) found in patients with CF called DF508. CF is caused by a lack of chloride movement in the nose, sinuses, lungs, intestines, pancreas and sweat glands. We are conducting this study to determine the safety of using a combination of two medicines, Phenylbutyrate and Genistein, to improve the ability of the cells lining the nose to regulate movement of salt (chloride) and water in people with CF. Phenylbutyrate has been extensively used to treat patients with rare metabolic diseases (which are very different from CF), Phenylbutyrate is an investigational drug for the purpose of this study. Genistein is a naturally occurring substance that is found in food products such as soy and tofu, but is also an investigational drug for this study. Both drugs may be able to restore normal chloride movements in body organs and glands. We will be studying salt and water in the nose movement by a technique called nasal transepithelial potential difference (NPD). \n",
      " Subjects will be randomized to receive either the Phenylbutyrate or placebo tablets for 1 week, with a 2 out of 3 chance of receiving Phenylbutyrate at a standard adult dose, with visits on study days 1, 4, and 7. The study will last an additional 2 weeks to determine whether the effects of the Phenylbutyrate or Placebo persist for any length of time, with visits on study days 14 and 21. Every participant will receive the Genistein during the NPD on days 1 and 7. The dose of Genistein used will not be escalated and will be the same for every participant. Safety evaluations at each visit will include a history, and physical exam and mental status exam, blood and urine tests, and lung function tests. The main physiologic outcome of the trial will be the assessment of salt and water transport NPD. In this way, we will assess whether genistein enhances the effect of phenylbutyrate to improve chloride transport in the nose by topical application of genistein to the nasal mucosa during the NPD procedure on study days 1 and 7. \n",

      "Title = Stopping and Restarting Anti-HIV Drugs in Children and Adolescents With Low Blood Levels of HIV.\n",
      " Some patients taking anti-HIV drugs as part of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) do not show any HIV in the blood; however, some HIV will remain hidden in the body and, if the drugs are stopped, will return to the blood. The purpose of this study is to determine if short periods of stopping HAART increase the activity of CD8 and CD4 cells (cells of the immune system that fight infection), if repeated stopping of these drugs for longer periods of time and restarting them will increase effectiveness of HAART, and if the increased immune system activity as a result of stopping treatment leads to lower levels of HIV over time. \n",
      " Some HIV infected patients taking HAART have been able to achieve prolonged suppression of HIV viral load for extended periods of time. However, discontinuing HAART has consistently resulted in HIV's return to plasma. Both CD8 and CD4 cells are markedly reduced in individuals with prolonged HIV suppression; control of and response to cell-associated HIV is dependent on immune-mediated mechanisms involving these cells. It is hypothesized that a brief and low-level increase in HIV levels resulting from HAART interruption might boost HIV-specific CD8 and CD4 T-cell counts. After suppression of viral load with the reintroduction of HAART, the expanded CD8 population might be able to better control viral replication and better respond to cell-associated HIV. Future treatment interruption may lead to longer periods of undetectable viral loads. Patients are divided into 2 age cohorts, with Cohort 1 consisting of children and adolescents 4 years and older up to 21 years of age, and Cohort 2 consisting of children and adolescents 2 years and older up to 4 years of age. Patients will be assigned to one of 2 groups. Group A patients will participate in drug holiday cycles from HAART and then back to HAART; Group B is a control group that remains on continuous HAART throughout the study. Cycle 1 for Group A patients begins with 18 days of HAART and a 3-day drug holiday. At the end of the drug holiday, viral load is measured and HAART is resumed for 28 days (detectable virus cycle) if viral load is detectable after the drug holiday. If viral load remains below the level of detection, the patient begins the next drug holiday cycle. With each subsequent drug holiday cycle, time off HAART will increase by 2 days. Patients failing 4 repeated detectable virus (28-day treatment) cycles will be taken off study. Patients will be enrolled in this study for a minimum of 142 weeks. For Group A, HIV viral load and CD4 cell count are measured at the end of each drug holiday and each HAART resumption; HIV-specific CD4 and CD8 responses are measured every 3 cycles; and cell-associated HIV is assessed at entry, at 12-week intervals, and at the end of the study. For Group B, physical exams are conducted and HIV viral load and other blood work are measured every 12 weeks. \n",

      " There is compelling epidemiological and clinical evidence to suggest that periodontal infection adversely affects glycemic control in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The purpose of this pilot project is to obtain important preliminary data necessary to support design of a full scale, multi-center randomized clinical trial (RCT) to evaluate the effect of treating periodontal infection on glycemic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This current project involves treating periodontal infection to obtain estimates of changes and the variability of those changes over time in the established primary endpoint, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). This project will also explore use of several potential secondary endpoints including levels of periodontitis and glucose metabolism-related inflammatory mediators (TNF-alpha, IL-1-beta, IL-6), serum cholesterol, triglyceride and lipids. Subjects are randomly assigned to 1 of three possible groups for comprehensive periodontal examination, specimen collection, mechanical periodontal therapy and oral systemic antibiotics or placebo, and regular follow-up evaluations and site-specific mechanical periodontal therapy, at 3-month intervals, for approximately 15 months. Two groups receive ultrasonic scaling with local anesthesia (as needed), local antimicrobial treatment with povidone-iodine irrigation, and an oral systemic antibiotic (either doxycycline or metronidazole) at the initial treatment visit. The third group (\"controls\") receives a placebo and supra-gingival oral prophylaxis and ultrasonic removal of supra-gingival calculus with water irrigation at the initial treatment visit. At the 9-month follow-up visit, \"controls\" receive sub-gingival ultrasonic scaling with povidone-iodine irrigation. Results from this pilot project will be used as preliminary data to support design of an immediate follow-up proposal to NIH/NIDCR for funding a multi-center RCT to evaluate the effect of treating periodontal infection on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. If results from the full scale clinical trial provide evidence that treating periodontal infection contributes to improved glycemic control, then diagnosis and treatment of periodontal infection in subjects with type 2 diabetes could be substantiated as an important component in management of diabetes. \n",

      " This study will try to determine if intake of dietary fats or carbohydrates influences the tendency to gain weight or accumulate body fat. It will examine how the hormones that regulate weight may change with a shift from a balanced diet to one that is low in fat or carbohydrate, irrespective of caloric intake. Men and women between the ages of 18 and 40 years with a body mass index of 30 to 49 kg/m2 may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a history, physical examination, blood tests and questionnaires regarding activity, prior diets, and eating patterns. Participants will follow two separate diet regimens for 5 days each. The first will be a balanced diet, and the second will be either a low-fat/high-carbohydrate diet or a low-carbohydrate/high-fat diet. The diets are not designed to produce weight loss. Participants will receive all their meals and snacks for the two diets from the National Institutes of Health and, for the first 3 days of each diet, will be seen as outpatients. For days 4 and 5 of each diet, they will be admitted to the Clinical Center and will undergo the following procedures: - Blood tests - Blood samples will be collected every 30 minutes over a 24-hour period through an indwelling catheter in the arm. A total of about 15 tablespoons will be drawn for each of the two diets. - 24-hour urine collection - One 24 hour urine collection will be done at home the day before admission to the Clinical Center, and the other will be done during the hospital stay. - Urinalysis and pregnancy test - A small urine sample will be taken and women will provide an additional sample for a pregnancy test. - Body measurements - Height and weight will be measured using scales. Body fat will be measured by two methods: skin fold thickness, measured with calipers in 5 separate places; and body circumference measurements, in which body parts are measured with a tape measure. - Bod pod measurement - Proportions of fat and non-fat tissue in body weight are measured while the participant sits in a capsule-like device for 5 minutes. - Bioelectric impedance analysis - Proportions of body fat are measured based on conduction of a small electric current. - Total body water estimate -The proportion of body weight that is water is determined, using a method that involves drinking a cup of a special kind of \"heavy\" water (deuterium) and then measuring the amount of heavy water in a urine sample taken after 4 hours. - Exercise - Participants will maintain their usual exercise routine, as it was before beginning the study. \n",
      " Caloric restriction triggers a number of homeostatic endocrine responses including suppression of leptin, gonadotropins, sex steroids, thyroid hormones, insulin and insulin like growth factors (IGFs) and elevation of growth hormone (GH) and cortisol. Some of these effects may be disadvantageous in terms of achieving loss of adipose tissue. There is little information on the role of specific macronutrients in the regulation of these important endocrine responses to food restriction. The present study aims to determine if dietary carbohydrate and/or lipid composition has significant effects on these hormonal regulators of body composition and metabolism, independent of total calorie supply. This will be achieved by comparing the short-term effects of isocaloric, weight maintenance diets restricted in either fat or carbohydrate with a standard balanced diet. Protein contribution as well as calorie content will be held constant in the 3 diets. Study subjects will be obese women and men (BMI 30-34.9 kg/m2) aged 18-40 years. Major study outcome parameters include: leptin, gonadotropin, GH and cortisol secretory dynamics; sex steroid, IGF, fasting insulin and glucose levels. \n",

Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill cancer cells. Peripheral stem cell transplant may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells. Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of cancer cells. It is not yet known whether giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) with radiation therapy and peripheral stem cell transplant is more effective than chemotherapy followed by interferon alfa in treating mantle cell lymphoma. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial compares how well chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and peripheral stem cell transplant works compared to chemotherapy plus interferon alfa in treating patients who have stage III or stage IV mantle cell lymphoma. \n",

Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of MOAB Hu1D10 until the MTD is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). If no DLT is observed, the biological effective dose (BED) is determined in the above cohorts. The BED is defined as the dose at which at least 4 of 6 patients experience an acceptable minimum trough level and clinical response. An additional 24 patients (12 per stratum) are treated at the MTD. Patients are followed at 1 week, 1 and 2 months, and then every 3 months for 1 year.

      " The purpose is to measure the effectiveness of recombinant human interleukin-4 receptor (IL-4R) in treating asthma. Asthma can be caused by the allergic response from breathing in certain irritants. Interleukin 4 (IL-4), which is naturally produced by the body, plays a major role in this allergic response. Doctors feel that IL-4 activity may be stopped by giving IL-4R, a product that binds to IL-4, and thereby decrease the problems of asthma. \n",
      " A major factor in the pathogenesis of asthma is the development of an allergic inflammatory response to inhaled antigens. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) plays a key role in this response. Binding and inactivating the IL-4 molecule with IL-4R may diminish the allergic asthmatic response by inhibiting activities of IL-4. Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups and, within each group, are stratified by baseline FEV1 cohort. Patients receive either dose level 1 of IL-4R, dose level 2 of IL-4R, or placebo, by aerosol drug delivery device, once a week for 12 weeks. There are frequent clinic visits and several follow-up visits. Physical exams and spirometry are done regularly; immunizations are administered on Day 28; and a skin tests panel is given on Day 84. Blood samples are collected at study visits during treatment and follow-up to test for immunology/serology parameters, chemistry profiles, and asthma-related DNA polymorphisms. Patients are provided with peak flow meters and must demonstrate their proper use so that a peak expiratory flow (PEF) diary and a symptoms diary can be maintained.

This trial will compare two anti-HIV treatment plans, one with and one without PIs, in women who start HIV treatment during pregnancy. The study will evaluate the effects of the anti-HIV drugs on the developing infant and prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission during pregnancy. \n",
      " The optimal treatment strategy for women who initiate antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy is not known. Although PI-based antiretroviral regimens are prescribed with increasing frequency among pregnant women, the efficacy and safety of this approach is unknown. Pregnant women are at increased risk for glucose intolerance and insulin resistance; PIs are associated with glucose intolerance. Physiologic differences between pregnant women and nonpregnant adults may alter the pharmacokinetics of antiretroviral regimens. Fetal safety considerations and effects on perinatal HIV transmission must also be considered when selecting an antiretroviral regimen for pregnant women. This trial will compare PI-based and PI-sparing antiretroviral regimens for women initiating antiretroviral therapy in pregnancy. Women will be stratified on the basis of viral load (50,000 or less copies/ml or greater than 50,000 copies/ml) and gestational age at entry (20 or less weeks or greater than 20 weeks) and then randomized to one of two treatment groups. Group A will receive the PI nelfinavir (NFV) with zidovudine (ZDV) and lamivudine (d4T); Group B will receive nevirapine (NVP) with ZDV and d4T. Women will have clinic visits for physical and obstetrical examinations at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after entry and then every 4 weeks until delivery. After delivery, infants in both groups may receive ZDV until they are 6 weeks old. Infants are evaluated for safety and to test the infant's blood for HIV-1 at birth and at Weeks 2, 8, 16, and 24.

      " RSH/Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is one that causes mental retardation. It is common in the Caucasian population but rare in African American and African black populations. It has been shown that SLOS is caused by a specific defect in DHCR7, an enzyme used in cholesterol metabolism. Studies have already been done to determine the frequency of the SLOS-causing mutations in various geographic Caucasian populations. This study will investigate the frequency of the DHCR7 mutations in the African American population. If the frequency observed suggests that SLOS cases are not being identified in this ethnic group, the study will provide the rationale for future studies to identify these patients. The sample size will be 1,600. The study population will consist of archived biological specimens in the form of newborn screening blood spots from two newborn screening centers, one in Maryland and one in Pennsylvania. Subjects will be of African American ethnicity, including blacks of African, Caribbean, and Central American descent. Genomic DNA will be extracted from blood spots and screened for the six common SLOS mutations. If SLOS syndrome is found, followup will be attempted for the Maryland samples (the Pennsylvania samples will be totally anonymous). \n",
      " RSH/Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is a multiple congenital anomaly/mental retardation syndrome caused by inborn error of cholesterol metabolism (Tint et al. 1994; Opitz 1999; Kelley 2000). Recent studies have shown SLOS to be one of the most common inherited metabolic defects in the Caucasian population. SLOS is believed to be rare in people of Chinese, Japanese, Indian, and Korean origin as well as in the African American and African Black population (Tsukahara et al. 1998; Yu et al 2000a; Witsch-Baumgartner et al. 2000; Witsch-Baumgartner et al. 2001, Battaile et al. 2001). The frequency spectra of DHCR7 mutations have been established for American Caucasians (Yu et al. 2000b, Battaile et al. 2001), mixed American Caucasian collection of patients (Witsch-Baumgartner et al 2000), for European ethnic groups from Poland, German/Austria, Great Britain (Witsch-Baumgartner et al. 2001) and from Italy (De Brasi et al. 1999). In these Caucasian populations, the most common mutations (IVS8-1G>C, W151X, V326L, R352W, R404C and T93M) account for 60% of SLOS mutant alleles. These suggest that frequent SLOS-causing mutations have different geographic origins and histories. This project will investigate the frequency gradient of DHCR7 mutations in the African American population. \n",

      "Title = Phenotype/Genotype Correlations in Neuromuscular Disorders.\n",
      " The Neuromuscular Diseases Section (NDS) is conducting research on certain inherited myopathies and neuropathies, disorders that lead to disability and sometimes death. NDS, along with other groups, has identified some disease-causing genes. The National Institutes of Health Clinical Center proposes new research to identify additional hereditary neuromuscular diseases and conduct genetic studies in order to localize, clone, and characterize the diseases. An expected 50 patients with known or suspected inherited myopathy or neuropathy and their families will be recruited for this study. If travel to the Clinical Center is impossible, investigators may come to them to do the tests. Ten to twenty cubic centimeters of blood will be drawn for DNA extraction and genotyping. Some abnormal movements of muscle atrophy will be documented by videotaping. If necessary, diagnostic laboratory and radiographic studies will be done to confirm diagnosis. Because the diseases are hereditary, blood may also be drawn from family members. The family will be counseled and the participants invited back annually to investigate the progression of the disease. Each participant will be evaluated by a history and initial neurological exam. Up to another 20 mL of blood will be drawn for routine blood studies. Other medical care procedures may include a chest x-ray, EKG and echocardiogram, CT (computed tomography) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan, pulmonary function tests, and physical therapy assessment. Possible research procedures may include MR spectroscopy, nerve conduction study, electromyography, muscle or nerve biopsy, and lumbar puncture. The researchers have decided not to inform the family if nonpaternity or adoption is discovered by the DNA genotyping. Also, because a carrier of the disease gene may not necessarily develop the disease, family members will not be informed if they are carriers. \n",
      " The goal of this protocol is to identify families with inherited neuromuscular disorders, evaluate disease manifestations to establish an accurate clinical diagnosis by using newest technological advances and investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Studies of inherited myopathies in large families with good genealogical records are especially valuable. Patients with diseases of known molecular basis will be genotyped to conduct analysis of phenotype/genotype correlation. Patients with diseases of unknown or incomplete genetic characterization will be studied with a hope of contributing to the identification of specific disease-causing genes and to genetic mechanisms responsible for a specific disorder. \n",

      " The purpose of this study is to find out whether certain anti-HIV drugs (efavirenz [EFV] and nelfinavir [NFV]) affect the amount of certain fat-lowering drugs (atorvastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin) in the blood. Protease inhibitors (PIs), a type of anti-HIV drug, are known to cause increased lipids (fats) in the blood of HIV-infected patients. EFV also is known to increase blood fats. HIV-infected patients who take PIs and/or EFV may need to take fat-lowering drugs to correct this problem. So it is important to look at possible drug interactions when these drugs are taken together. This study will see if taking EFV or NFV, a protease inhibitor, affects the blood level of simvastatin, atorvastatin, or pravastatin (all fat-lowering drugs). To obtain results more quickly, the study population will be healthy HIV-negative volunteers. \n",
      " Abnormalities in lipid metabolism are a recognized side effect of protease inhibitor (PI) therapy in HIV-infected patients. EFV also is known to increase plasma cholesterol. In an attempt to normalize serum lipids in HIV-infected patients on PIs and/or EFV, Hydroxymethylglutaryl Coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (also known as statins) may be prescribed. Therefore, it is important to study how PIs and EFV affect the PK of concurrently-administered statins. Many of the statins utilize the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 enzyme for metabolism. In addition, atorvastatin and simvastatin have active metabolites, generated via CYP3A4, that contribute to the drugs' lipid-lowering activity and probably to their toxicity. Pravastatin is not metabolized by CYP3A4 but is inactivated by conjugation, non-CYP3A4-induced hydroxylation, and renal excretion. NFV, the most commonly used PI, is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and an inducer of other CYPs and conjugative pathways. EFV is a mixed CYP3A4 inhibitor and inducer. This study examines the effect of NFV on the PK of pravastatin and the effect of EFV on the PK of simvastatin, atorvastatin, and pravastatin. As EFV with pravastatin is expected to be a common drug combination during the treatment of HIV infection, it should be explored further, even though drug interactions are not expected. To expedite this study, the study population is comprised of healthy control volunteers. Volunteers are assigned to 1 of 4 groups. Volunteers in Groups A, B, and C take a statin (simvastatin, atorvastatin, or pravastatin, respectively) on Days 0 to 3. After Day 3, the statin is stopped and EFV is begun. Volunteers take EFV until Day 14 and the statin and EFV together from Days 15 to 18. Volunteers in Group D take pravastatin on Days 0 to 3, NFV on Days 4 to 12, and pravastatin and NFV together on Days 13 to 16. Fasting lipid profiles are performed on Days 0, 4, 15, and 19 for Groups A, B, and C, and on Days 0, 3, 13, and 16 for Group D. PK sampling is performed on Days 3, 14, and 18 for Groups A, B, and C (requiring an overnight stay), and on Days 3 and 16 for Group D.

Another purpose is to see if nerve exams are done correctly before clinical research sites enroll HIV-infected patients. Nerve damage is common in patients with HIV infection and can cause serious problems. The factors that place patients at risk are not well understood. This study will examine these factors in patients with advanced HIV infection and who have been taking anti-HIV drugs. \n",
      " Neurological complications in HIV infection are common and are significant sources of mortality and morbidity. The associated risk factors have not been clearly defined. Several studies have patients who are suited for analysis of peripheral neuropathy and can address the important clinical question of when a subject with asymptomatic neuropathy is most at risk for progressing to painful neuropathy. Some patients in this population with advanced HIV disease will likely have asymptomatic peripheral neuropathy at baseline, and will present an excellent opportunity for prospective study. Detailed quantitative assessments will be carried out to determine the incidence and course of peripheral neuropathy in this population. Risk factors for the development of new peripheral neuropathy, worsening of existing neuropathy, and progression to symptomatic peripheral neuropathy, such as CD4+ cell counts, HIV-1 viral load, and prior nucleoside analogue use, will be evaluated. The potential additive neurotoxic effects of hydroxyurea exposure in this population can also be analyzed. HIV-infected patients are characterized for the presence or absence of neuropathy at [AS PER AMENDMENT 03/05/02: screening], baseline, Week 24, and Week 48. Entry variables are analyzed to determine predictors of progression from asymptomatic to symptomatic neuropathy or for worsening of symptomatic neuropathy. HIV-uninfected control volunteers have 1 visit [AS PER AMENDMENT 03/05/02: or 2 visits] for nerve conduction and Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) evaluations to demonstrate proficiency with the testing methods prior to the enrollment of HIV-infected patients. HIV-infected patients are evaluated with the components of the Total Neuropathy Score (TNS) which includes signs (motor function, sensory function, and reflexes), symptoms (motor symptoms and sensory symptoms), QST (CASE IV - vibratory, cooling, and heat pain thresholds), and nerve conduction studies (sural nerve and peroneal nerve). Other evaluations include the Gracely Pain Scale and Visual Analog Scale pain diaries, paired skin biopsies from the right thigh and distal leg (total of 2), and peripheral blood lymphocyte analysis for quantitation of mitochondrial DNA content at entry and final study visit. \n",

      " The purpose of this study is to make valganciclovir available, before it is approved for marketing, to HIV-infected patients who have cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis (eye infection) and cannot take drugs by injection. This study also will look at the safety of using valganciclovir as starting and/or ongoing therapy. CMV can cause serious AIDS-related infections in patients with HIV. Drugs that are effective against CMV eye infections can be given only by injection; this calls for a thin tube to be placed into a vein in the chest so that the patient is not put through getting too many needle sticks. An experimental drug, valganciclovir, is similar to 1 of these approved drugs, ganciclovir, but is more convenient and easier to use since it can be taken by mouth. Once in the body, valganciclovir changes to ganciclovir. Studies have shown that valganciclovir tablets can result in the same level of ganciclovir in the blood as ganciclovir injection. \n",
      " CMV causes sight- or life-threatening opportunistic infections in people with AIDS. Intravenous agents including ganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir are presently approved as treatments for CMV retinitis within this population. Ganciclovir and foscarnet induction and maintenance therapy require daily infusions and usually require the use of long-term indwelling central venous catheters. Although the treatment interval of cidofovir is longer, administration necessitates the use of pre-hydration and probenecid in order to avoid a risk of renal toxicity. Oral ganciclovir is an alternative to the intravenous formulation for the maintenance treatment of CMV retinitis. However, because blood levels achieved after oral ganciclovir are low compared to intravenous, oral ganciclovir cannot be used for induction therapy. In an attempt to improve the bioavailability of ganciclovir, valganciclovir was developed. Valganciclovir is a ganciclovir prodrug which, when administered orally, is rapidly converted to the active compound ganciclovir during a first-pass process, with the majority of hydrolysis occurring pre-systemically. Studies have shown that valganciclovir tablets allow systemic exposure of ganciclovir comparable to that achieved with recommended doses of intravenous ganciclovir. Patients undergo an ophthalmologic exam by an ophthalmologist and safety and other laboratory tests to establish eligibility. No specific visits are requested by the drug usage plan following enrollment; however, patients should be seen for safety and/or clinical assessments and medication dispensation at periodic visits, consistent with standard of care. An ophthalmologic exam should be performed again at Week 3 (no later than Week 4), at the end of the induction treatment phase consistent with standard of care in order to ensure adequate response to therapy. Valganciclovir is provided on a monthly basis and only as long as the patient is assessed and information provided in a timely manner. This supply will be terminated 1 month subsequent to when the drug is available by prescription, unless otherwise decided. \n",

HIV-infected people generally are treated with a combination of different types of anti-HIV drugs, 1 of which is usually a PI. The same holds true for pregnant women, but not much is known about the use of these drugs in pregnancy. Blood sugar and liver problems caused by anti-HIV drugs in nonpregnant patients are well known but their effects in pregnancy are not. Also, certain physical changes brought about by pregnancy may affect the way drugs are handled in the body. There remains a need for further study into the use of anti-HIV drugs during pregnancy and their effect on the safety of the mother and baby. \n",
      " The dramatic impact of potent combination antiretroviral therapies on the course of HIV disease has made the use of PIs routine in the care of HIV-1-infected individuals. Combination therapy likewise has become the standard of care in pregnant individuals, even though information on use of these drugs during human pregnancy is limited. There are no published prospective evaluations of toxicities experienced by pregnant women on PI-containing antiretroviral regimens, despite findings of metabolic disturbances of glucose, fatty acids, and cholesterol, as well as lactic acidosis/hepatic steatosis in nonpregnant individuals treated with antiretrovirals. Gastrointestinal (GI) side effects also are well documented in nonpregnant individuals treated with PIs, but have not been systematically evaluated in pregnancy. In addition, the physiologic changes brought about by pregnancy may influence the pharmacokinetics, safety, and side effects of antiretroviral drugs. There remains a need for further evaluation of the use of antiretrovirals during pregnancy and their impact on maternal, fetal, and infant safety. Patients are stratified according to whether or not they are on a PI-containing antiretroviral regimen and the number of weeks of gestation (26 weeks or less versus greater than 26 weeks). Patients are followed at 8-week intervals from the time of entry until delivery or pregnancy termination, with an additional visit at 12 weeks after delivery or pregnancy termination. All infants born to study participants are evaluated at the time of delivery (anthropometrics and HIV DNA PCR) and are seen again at the mothers' 12-week post-delivery visit. Glucose tolerance testing and other metabolic studies are performed serially during pregnancy and again postpartum. This is an observational study and drugs are not supplied. Patients receiving antiretroviral therapy must obtain their own medications. \n",

      "Title = Mechanisms Linking Depression to Cardiovascular Risk.\n",
      " To examine the role of depression on risk for cardiovascular disease in twins. \n",
      " BACKGROUND: Multiple studies have demonstrated a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and worse cardiovascular disease (CVD) prognosis associated with depression that appear to synergistically and significantly adversely impact health. Because these initial studies are observational, much work remains to understand this area. If these conditions are mechanistically inter-related, identification of both conditions in the same subject may provide a means of enhancing risk stratification and most appropriately targeting therapy. If the interaction between the conditions is causal not simply associative, appropriate therapy interventions can be designed and tested. DESIGN NARRATIVE: The project is designed to clarify the role of depression on CVD risk by using a co-twin study design. The study will examine twin pairs from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry (VET). Twin pairs will be invited to participate if they meet two criteria: (1) neither has a history of CVD as of 1990 and (2) one twin is diagnosed with depression as of 1992. The study investigates the effects of depression on two indicators of \"early\" CVD: coronary flow reserve, assessed by means of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) myocardial infusion imaging; and heart rate variability (HRV) assessed by ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. It is hypothesized that within each pair, the twins who have clinical depression will exhibit lower coronary vascular reserve and lower heart rate variability compared with their co-twins without a history of depression. Moreover, by comparing the size of the intra-pair difference in these parameters between depression discordant monozygotic and dizygotic twins an estimate of the relative contributions of gene and environmental factors can be ascertained. In addition to the PET and HRV assessments, subjects will complete the Statistical Clinical Interview of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV SCID) to document a history of depression, a psychometric battery including the Early Trauma Inventory and Hamilton Depression Scale, and such risk factors as cigarette smoking, physical activity, blood pressure and blood lipids, glucose and insulin, indices of inflammation and thrombogenicity including levels of reactive protein C, fibrinogen, and P-selectin, and neurohormones such as adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate. \n",

      "Title = Anti-Interleukin-5 Antibody to Treat Hypereosinophilic Syndrome.\n",
      " This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of a single dose of anti-interleukin-5 antibody (SCH 55700) in reducing the number of eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) in patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome. Patients with this disease have too many eosinophils in the blood and in body tissues, which cause damage to the affected organs-most commonly the heart, nerves and skin. SCH 55700 is an antibody to interleukin 5-a hormone-like substance produced by white blood cells that plays a significant role in eosinophilia. SCH 55700 has lowered eosinophilia blood counts in patients with asthma and reduced the number of these cells in tissues of animals with asthma. Patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome 18 years of age and older who have not responded to standard therapy with steroids, interferon and hydroxyurea or cannot take these drugs may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, eye examination, and blood tests. Depending on the patient's symptoms, other diagnostic tests may be done, including studies of the eyes, lungs, skin, nerves or heart. Skin biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage may be included in the diagnostic evaluation. For the skin biopsy, a small area about 1/3 inch in diameter is numbed and a small core of skin is surgically removed for study under the microscope. Bronchoalveolar lavage involves inserting a catheter (flexible tube) into the lungs to instill saline (salt water) and obtain a tissue sample. This test will be done only if clinically necessary. Those enrolled in the study will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for a single dose of SCH 55700, injected into an arm vein. They will be monitored in the hospital for at least 72 hours for changes in eosinophil count and side effects of the injection. After discharge, laboratory tests will be done weekly for the first month, either at the Clinical Center or by the patient's local physician. Follow-up visits will then be scheduled monthly for 1 year or until the patient's eosinophil count returns to pre-treatment levels for 2 consecutive months. Follow-up visits will include a history, physical examination and blood tests, including studies on how immune cells and other substances in the blood activate or stimulate eosinophilia. A chest X-ray, electrocardiogram and pulmonary function tests will be done at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months to evaluate organ damage. Other tests may be done if medically indicated. Bone marrow biopsy and aspiration will be done before receiving SCH 55700 and one month after the injection to evaluate the effects of SCH 55700 on eosinophil production in the bone marrow. For this test, an area of skin and bone is numbed and a very sharp needle is used to withdraw a sample of the bone marrow. Leukapheresis will also be done before and 1 month after SCH 55700 treatment to obtain cells for studying the effect of SCH 55700 on eosinophil activation, function and survival. For this procedure, whole blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein. The blood circulates through a machine that separates it into its components. The white cells are then removed, and the rest of the blood is returned to the body, either through the same needle used to draw the blood or through a second needle placed in the other arm. \n",
      " The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of humanized monoclonal anti-IL5 antibody, SCH 55700 in reducing peripheral blood eosinophilia in patients with either hypereosinophilic syndrome or eosinophilic gastroenteritis. Patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome refractory to or intolerant of therapy with conventional therapy (steroids, hydroxyurea and interferon alpha) will be admitted on this protocol. Additionally, subjects with eosinophilic gastroenteritis refractory or intolerant to conventional therapy (systemic glucocorticoids) will be admitted on this protocol. A thorough clinical evaluation will be performed with emphasis on potential sequelae of eosinophil-mediated tissue damage. A baseline bone marrow will be obtained to exclude neoplasia and to assess the degree and nature of eosinophilipoiesis. Blood cells and/or serum will also be collected to provide reagents (such as DNA, RNA, and specific antibodies) for use in the laboratory to address issues related to the immunologic basis of FHES and GE as well as their pathogenesis and treatment. Following intravenous administration of a single 1 mg/kg dose of the humanized monoclonal anti-IL5 antibody, SCH 55700, patients will be followed in an inpatient setting for a minimum of 72 hours for monitoring of adverse effects secondary to the infusion. Followup visits will be scheduled monthly for 1 year or until the peripheral eosinophil count returns to baseline. Patients showing a reduction in eosinophilia and evidence of clinical improvement will be eligible to receive 5 additional doses of 1 mg/kg of SCH 55700 at monthly intervals. \n",

      "Title = Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) Studies of Dystonia.\n",
      " This study will use transcranial magnetic stimulation to examine how the brain controls muscle movement in focal and generalized types of dystonia. Dystonia is a movement disorder in which involuntary muscle contractions cause uncontrolled twisting or abnormal postures. Dystonia may be focal, involving just one region of the body, such as the hand, neck or face. Focal dystonia usually begins in adulthood. Generalized dystonia, on the other hand, generally begins in childhood or adolescence. Symptoms begin in one area and then become more widespread. Healthy normal volunteers and patients with focal or generalized dystonia 8 years of age and older may be eligible for this study. First-degree relatives of patients will also be enrolled. In transcranial magnetic stimulation, an insulated wire coil is placed on the subject's scalp and brief electrical currents are passed through the coil, creating magnetic pulses that pass into the brain. These pulses generate very small electrical currents in the cortex-the outer part of the brain-briefly disrupting the function of the brain cells in the stimulated area. The stimulation may cause muscle twitching or tingling in the scalp, face and limbs. During the stimulation, the subject will be asked to either keep the hand relaxed or to slightly tense certain muscles in the hand or arm. The test will last about 1.5 hours. The cause of dystonia is unknown. It is hoped that a comparison of brain activity in normal volunteers, patients and their relatives not affected by dystonia will help scientists learn why some people develop dystonic movements. \n",
      " The objective of this study is to evaluate intracortical inhibition (ICI) in focal dystonia and in generalized dystonia of known genetic origin (DYT1 dystonia) in order to determine whether abnormalities of ICI can represent a marker of genetic predisposition for the development of dystonia. It is unclear why some carriers of the DYT1 dystonia do not develop dystonic symptoms. One possible explanation is that the development of dystonia is a two-stage process: first, loss of ICI (which may be genetically determined) and, second, exposure to an environmental trigger such as excessive repetitive movements. Thus we hypothesize that impaired ICI may serve as a marker for the DYT1 carrier state. There is good evidence that focal dystonia is a genetically determined disorder, but the gene responsible remains undetermined. We hypothesize that, in up to 50% of first degree relatives of patients with focal dystonia, impaired ICI may be found which would serve as a gene marker for the abnormality. In those individuals with this genetic marker of impaired ICI, further linkage analysis studies could be performed to identify the causative gene. In this study, we propose to measure ICI using transcranial magnetic stimulation in patients with both focal and generalized forms of dystonia, their first degree relatives and an age matched control group. \n",

      "Title = A Study of the Effects of Pegvisomant on Growth Hormone Excess in McCune-Albright Syndrome.\n",
      " This study will examine the effect of pegvisomant on growth hormone excess in patients with McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS). Patients with this disease have polyostotic fibrous dysplasia-a condition in which areas of normal bone are replaced with fibrous growth similar to scar tissue, abnormal skin pigmentation (birth marks) and precocious (early) puberty. About 10 percent of patients have excess growth hormone (GH). GH stimulates the production of another hormone called insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). Together, GH and IGF-1 affect bone growth. The excess of these hormones in MAS can cause overgrowth of the bones of the face, hands and feet, excess sweating, or increased height. Pegvisomant is a synthetic drug that binds to cell receptors where GH would normally bind, thus preventing the naturally occurring hormone from stimulating IGF-1 and bone growth as it normally would. This study will see if pegvisomant will reduce blood levels of IGF-1 and mitigate the effects of growth hormone excess, including bone pain, bone turnover, hand and foot swelling and sweating, and abnormal levels of related hormones. Patients who were screened for polyostotic fibrous dysplasia and MAS under NIH protocol 98-D-0145 and were found to have MAS with excess growth hormone are eligible for this 36-week study. The screening protocol includes a history and physical examination, blood and urine tests, hearing, eye and dental examinations, pain and physical function evaluations, endocrine and bone screening tests, various bone imaging studies, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans and bone biopsy in patients over 6 years old. Participants in the current study will receive daily injections of either pegvisomant or placebo (an inactive substance) for 12 weeks, followed by a 6-week \"washout\" period with no drug. Then, patients who received placebo will be switched, or \"crossed over,\" to receive pegvisomant for another 12 weeks, and those who received pegvisomant will receive placebo. This will be followed by another 6-week washout period. The drug and placebo will be injected under the skin, similar to insulin injections. Blood and urine tests will be done at the beginning of the study and repeated every 6 weeks until the study ends. \n",
      " McCune-Albright Syndrome (MAS) was originally described as the triad of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia of bone, cafe-au-lait skin pigmentation and precocious puberty. Other endocrine abnormalities have been identified in this disease. Growth hormone (GH) excess is associated with MAS and occurs in approximately 10% of the patients. Current therapies of MAS involve separate treatment for the bone and endocrine diseases. We propose to test the effectiveness of a novel GH receptor antagonist, pegvisomant at reducing the growth hormone excess in these patients. Secondarily we shall also assess the impact of pegvisomant therapy on the fibrous dysplastic bone lesions associated with the disease. The subjects will be patients with MAS and non-suppressible growth hormone as determined by standard oral glucose tolerant testing (OGTT) and an elevated insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I). It will be a randomized, blinded crossover design. The primary and secondary measures of efficacy will be: the normalization of serum (IGF-I), a reduction in signs and symptoms of growth hormone excess, and a net change in Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3 (IGFBP-3). The effect of pegvisomant on the fibrous dysplastic bone activity in these patients will be determined by a net change in the levels of bone turnover markers. \n",

      " Although the precise pathogenesis of AD is unknown, certain pathological features accompany the disease. These pathological features include the abnormal accumulation of extracellular amyloid, the formation of intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles, synapse loss, and cellular degeneration. Cellular degeneration occurs in several neuronal populations in the central nervous system. Among the neuronal populations that degenerate in AD, loss of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons is particularly severe. Loss of cholinergic neurons in AD correlates best with severity of dementia, the density of amyloid plaques in the brain, and the amount of synapse. To date, the only FDA-approved therapies for Alzheimer's Disease focus on augmenting the function of degenerating cholinergic neurons. The present trial will move beyond compensating for cholinergic neuronal degeneration by attempting to 1) protect cholinergic neurons from degeneration, and 2) augment the function of remaining cholinergic neurons by directly elevating choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) function in neurons. These two therapeutic interventions will be brought about by the delivery of human NGF to the brain. NGF has been shown to prevent both lesion-induced and spontaneous, age-related degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. Further, NGF infusions reversed both lesion-induced memory loss and spontaneous, age-related memory loss in rodents. Based on these findings, NGF administration offers significant potential as a neuroprotective strategy in Alzheimer's disease. Grafts of primary fibroblasts transduced to express human nerve growth factor have been shown to sustain NGF in vivo gene expression for at least eighteen months in the rodent central nervous system. In addition, these grafts sustain NGF messenger RNA production for at least 14 months in vivo. In primate systems, ex vivo NGF gene therapy has been demonstrated to sustain NGF protein production in the brain in the rhesus money for at least one year. Thus, the available data suggests that ex vivo NGF gene therapy is an effective means of preventing loss of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons and of augmenting cholinergic function in the primate brain. In animals, this procedure is safe and well tolerated. Based on these data, clinical trials of ex vivo NGF gene therapy in Alzheimer's disease has begun. This is an 18 month, open label, prospective Phase I clinical trial of Ex Vivo Gene Therapy for Alzheimer's disease in 8 patients with a mild degree of cognitive impairment. Patients will be screened for the diagnosis of Probable Alzheimer's disease of mild severity. After obtaining informed consent, three skin biopsies will be obtained to generate cultures of primary, autologous fibroblasts. These cells will be cultured, then genetically modified to produce and secrete the human nerve growth factor (NGF) molecule. If fibroblasts are deemed acceptable based on NGF production rates and standard cell culture sterility tests, then patients will receive intracerebral injections of their own primary fibroblasts into the region of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in the brain, where neurons are undergoing atrophy as a result of Alzheimer's disease. \n",

The electrical activity of the muscle will be recorded on a computer through electrodes applied to the skin over the muscle. In most cases, the study will last less than 3 hours. \n",
      " The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of voluntary inhibition of movement, using either negative motor imagery or Go/NoGo reaction task, on cortical inhibitory mechanisms. Intracortical inhibition (ICI) and silent period (SP) are two major cortical inhibitory mechanisms demonstrated by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Alterations in these inhibitory mechanisms have been extensively studied in various situations, but the influence of voluntary inhibition has not been elucidated yet. In normal volunteers, therefore, we plan to determine if voluntary inhibition of movement influences these cortical inhibitory mechanisms. The primary outcome measures would be any changes in motor evoked potential (MEP) size and intracortical inhibition (ICI) parameters. \n",

      " This study will test whether a self-management (SM) intervention, compared to usual care, will reduce the risk for adverse clinical outcome in patients with mild to moderate heart failure. \n",
      " BACKGROUND: Heart failure is a major disabling disease for American adults, affecting an estimated 4.9 million individuals. Heart failure is associated with enormous health care expenditures. This is because it is a progressive chronic condition that is characterized by disabling symptoms that limit independence and result in multiple hospitalizations and referrals to long-term care. The emergence of heart failure as a major public health problem is related to the unintended result of both an aging population and the success in reducing mortality from cardiovascular disease. Non-adherence to medications is a key problem in the treatment of heart failure, with adherence rates ranging from 20% to 90%. There is a clear need, therefore, to develop interventions that improve adherence in patients with heart failure. DESIGN NARRATIVE: This is a single-site, partially blinded, randomized clinical trial of 900 patients with systolic or diastolic dysfunction, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II or III. Patients will be recruited over a period of 2 years from seven hospitals. Patients will be randomly assigned to either a SM intervention or attention control. The SM group will meet 18 times for 2 hours over 1 year. These group sessions will teach patients how to use five basic self-management skills (self-monitoring, environmental restructuring, social support, cognitive restructuring, and the relaxation response) to help build self-efficacy and maintain it after the treatment has been discontinued. The attention control arm will consist of an educational intervention which includes 18 mailings of the American Heart Association Tip Sheets over the course of the first year, plus a telephone follow-up with the patient after each mailing to check receipt and comprehension of the Tip Sheet, and to address any questions about the Tip Sheet. Treatment effects will be evaluated using the primary outcome of hospitalization for heart failure or death, and the secondary outcomes of progression of heart failure, quality of life, and health care costs. Potential mediators of effectiveness will include improved adherence and improved psychosocial function. \n",

      "Title = Gene Transfer Therapy for Severe Combined Immunodeficieny Disease (SCID) Due to Adenosine Deaminase (ADA) Deficiency.\n",
      " This study will evaluate a new method for delivering gene transfer therapy to patients with severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) due to a defective adenosine deaminase (ADA) gene. This gene codes for the adenosine deaminase enzyme, which is essential for the proper growth and function of infection-fighting white blood cells called T and B lymphocytes. Patients who lack this enzyme are vulnerable to frequent and severe infections. Some patients with this disease receive enzyme replacement therapy with weekly injections of the drug PEG-ADA (ADAGEN). This drug may increase the number of immune cells and reduce infections, but it is not a cure. Gene transfer therapy, in which a normal ADA gene is inserted into the patient s cells, attempts to correct the underlying cause of disease. This therapy has been tried in a small number of patients with varying degrees of success. In this study, the gene will be inserted into the patient s stem cells (cells produced by the bone marrow that mature into the different blood components white cells, red cells and platelets). Patients with ADA deficiency and SCID who are taking PEG-ADA and are not candidates for HLA-identical sibling donor bone marrow transplantation may be eligible for this study. Participants will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for 2 to 3 days. Stem cells will be collected either from cord blood (in newborn patients) or from the bone marrow. The bone marrow procedure is done under light sedation or general anesthesia. It involves drawing a small amount of marrow through a needle inserted into the hip bone. The stem cells in the marrow will be grown in the laboratory and a normal human ADA gene will be transferred into them through a special type of disabled mouse virus. A few days later, the patient will receive the ADA-corrected cells through an infusion in the vein that will last from 10 minutes to 2 hours. Patients will be evaluated periodically for immune function with blood tests, skin tests, and reactions to tetanus, diphtheria, H. influenza B and S. pneumoniae vaccinations. The survival of ADA-corrected cells will be monitored through blood tests. The number and amount of blood tests will depend on the patient s age, weight and health, but is expected that blood will not be drawn more than twice a month. Patients will also undergo bone marrow biopsy aspirate (as described above) twice a year. Patients will be followed once a year indefinitely to evaluate the long-term effects of therapy. \n",
      " This is a clinical gene transfer study that aims to verify the safety and efficacy of the use of retroviral vectors to introduce the human adenosine deaminase (ADA) gene into the hematopoietic progenitors of patients affected with severe combined immunodeficiency due to ADA deficiency. In addition, this protocol will examine the effects of the ADA gene transfer on the immune system of treated patients. Patients with ADA deficiency and ineligible for matched sibling allogeneic bone marrow transplantation are eligible to participate to the study. To increase engraftment and selective advantage of gene-corrected cells, busulfan will be used as cytoreduction agent and enzyme replacement (PEG-ADA) therapy will be discontinued. CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors will be isolated from the patient bone marrow or cord blood, exposed to retroviral vector-mediated gene transfer and reinfused into the patient through a peripheral vein. Clinical, immunological and molecular follow-up studies will assess safety, toxicity, and efficacy of the procedure. \n",

      "Title = Peginterferon Alpha-2b And Ribavirin to Treat Hepatitis C in HIV-Infected Patients.\n",
      " This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of combination therapy with peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin for treating hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in HIV-infected patients. In studies of patients with hepatitis C alone, interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin treatment eradicated the HCV in almost half the patients. Peginterferon alfa-2b is a compound that results from attaching a polyethylene glycol molecule to interferon alfa-2b. This compound stays in the blood longer than unmodified interferon alfa-2b, causing a higher blood concentration and thus maintaining activity against the hepatitis C virus. HIV-infected patients 21 years of age and older with chronic hepatitis C infection and a viral load greater than 2000 copies/mL may be eligible for this 2 1/2-year study. Candidates will be screened with blood and urine tests and possibly a liver biopsy, if a recent one is not available. The liver biopsy is done to determine the severity of liver disease. For this test, patients are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for 1 to 2 days. A sedative is injected into an arm vein, the skin in the area over the biopsy site is numbed with a local anesthetic, and a needle is inserted rapidly into and out of the liver to obtain a small tissue sample. The patient remains in the hospital overnight for monitoring. A chest X-ray, electrocardiogram (EKG) and liver ultrasound are also done. Within 4 weeks of the screening tests, candidates who appear eligible for the study will have a physical examination, medical history and repeat blood tests. Women who can become pregnant will have serial pregnancy tests throughout the study. Patients who meet the study criteria and decide to participate will begin treatment with weekly injections under the skin of peginterferon alfa-2b and take ribavirin pills twice a day by mouth. In addition, patients will continue to take all other medications prescribed by their doctor. Clinic visits will be scheduled as follows: - Days 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 21 - Blood will be drawn for safety tests and to measure blood levels of HIV and HCV. - Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 52, 56 and 64 - Blood and urine tests will be done to determine the side effects of treatment and its effect on the HCV infection. - Week 48 or end of treatment - Treatment will stop after 48 weeks. At this time, or earlier for those who do not complete the 48 weeks, patients will return to the clinic for a routine test. \n",
      " Hepatitis C infection occurs in one-third of all HIV-infected individuals. Liver disease has become more clinically significant among patients coinfected with HIV and HCV. Several studies have shown that coinfected individuals develop earlier and severe liver disease. Interferon with ribavirin has become the therapy of choice among people with non-genotype 1a. This is a pilot study to address the relationship of clinical response to combination therapy to the virologic and immunologic parameters. The study will also address the safety and efficacy of the peginterferon alfa-2b among HIV- infected individuals. The predictive ability of baseline HCV viral load, rate of decline of HCV viral load, HIV viral load and CD4 counts to the clinical response of chronic hepatitis to peginterferon and ribavirin will also be studied. Approximately sixty patients who are infected with both HIV and HCV and also have evidence of fibrosis will receive peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin for 48 weeks. In order to enroll sixty patients for this study, we will be screening a total of 180 patients. During the 72 weeks study these patients will be monitored for HCV viral load, and other HIV viral load and CD4 counts. Viral kinetics will also be monitored closely and the slope of second, slower phase decline of HCV viral load, which corresponds to the rate of infected cell death presumably may lead to sustained hepatitis C virologic response. The results of the study will enable us to better delineate the possible predictors of sustained response to peginterferon and ribavirin. The safety and tolerability of a combination therapy with peginterferon and ribavirin among HIV-infected individuals on antiretroviral therapy will further define the standard therapy of chronic hepatitis C in HIV-infected individuals. \n",

      "Title = Study of Mycobacterial Infections.\n",
      " This study will examine the symptoms, course of disease and treatment of non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infections, as well as the genetics involved in these infections. Patients with NTM have recurrent lung infections and sometimes infections of the skin and other organs as well. They may also have curvature of the spine, barrel chest, and heart valve weakness. The study will compare the features of NTM with those of Job syndrome and cystic fibrosis, other diseases involving recurrent infections of the lungs and possibly other organs. Patients with diagnosed or suspected non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection, cystic fibrosis or Job syndrome may be eligible for this study. All participants will have a medical and family history, blood and urine tests, imaging studies that may include X-rays, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, and DNA and other genetic studies. In addition, all patients with Job syndrome and cystic fibrosis, and patients with NTM who have lung disease undergo the following procedures: - Scoliosis survey X-rays of the spine to look for curvature or other abnormalities of the spinal column - Echocardiography imaging test that uses sound waves to examine the heart chambers and valves - Electrocardiogram measurement of the electrical activity of the heart - Pulmonary function tests breathing tests to measure how much air the patient can move into and out of the lungs - Body measurements measurements of height, weight, arm span, finger length, etc. - Joint function assessment of joint mobility using different maneuvers to test flexibility of joints and ligaments - Examination of physical features that might be associated with NTM, such as high arched palate of the mouth, flat feet, or certain skin features - Dermatology (skin) examination for reactive skin conditions or other skin problems and possibly a skin biopsy (surgical removal of a small skin tissue sample for microscopic examination) - Interview with genetics specialist These tests may require several days to complete. Patients with NTM will also be examined by a cystic fibrosis specialist and may have a sweat test. In addition, NTM patients will be asked to return to NIH every year for 5 years for follow-up tests, if medically indicated, including CT of the chest, scoliosis survey and examination by other specialists. \n",
      " The nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are ubiquitous environmental organisms foundin soil and water that rarely cause disease in humans. Since exposure to these organisms is universal and disease is rare, it can be concluded that normal host defenses are almost always sufficient to prevent infection. It follows that otherwise healthy individuals who develop disease must have abnormal susceptibility or immune defects that permit infection with nontubercuolous mycobacteria. The organisms that are most commonly encountered in clinical practice include Mycobacterium avium, and M. intracellulare [collectively known as the M. avium complex (MAC)], M. kansasii, M. fortuitum, M. abscessus, and M. chelonae. These organisms share significant structural and biochemical similarities with their more pathogenic relative, M. tuberculosis (MTB). Recognition of host factors that predispose or lead to NTM infection may have important implications for pathogenesis and therapeutic intervention, and may be applicable to the more virulent MTB. Identification of genetic or acquired susceptibility factors may lead to recognition of endogenous pathways that can be exploited therapeutically and to possible gene identification. Over the last two decades, three important observations have been made regarding the pathogenesis of nontuberculous mycobacterial infections. 1) In patients infected with HIV, nontuberculous mycobacterial infections often occur when the CD4+ T-lymphocyte number falls below 50/mm3. This suggested that specific T cell products or activities were required for mycobacterial resistance. 2) An association was noted between pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial infections and a particular body habitus, predominantly in post-menopausal women (pectus excavatum, scoliosis, mitral valve prolapse). 3) Multiple defects have been found involving the interferon gamma synthesis and use pathways in patients with disseminated nontuberculous mycobacterial infection without HIV, suggesting this is a critical pathway for host defense against these organisms. We seek to better characterize the predisposition to mycobacterial infection. This study will specifically address several aspects of immune function and investigate the proposed link to body morphotype in the relevant population. By collecting this information, we hope to provide insight into disease associations, infection susceptibility, and genetic predisposition to mycobacterial infection. \n",

      "Title = Clinical Trial of Fluoxetine in Anxiety and Depression in Children, and Associated Brain Changes.\n",
      " Objective: This protocol uses functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine neuro-cognitive correlates of pediatric and adult mood and anxiety disorders. The primary goal of the project is to document, in pediatric anxiety disorders and major depression, perturbations in brain systems mediating attention biases, fear conditioning, emotional memory, and response to various forms of motivational stimuli. As one secondary goal, the project measures the relationship between these factors and treatment response to either fluoxetine, a specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), or interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT). Another secondary goal examines similar associations in adults. Study Population: A total of 2530 children, adolescents, and adults will be recruited. Most subjects will not be able to complete all procedures. We seek to comprehensively study 150 juveniles with only a current anxiety disorder, 60 juveniles with current major depression, 150 juveniles with no psychiatric disorder, 100 adults with major depression, 60 adults with an anxiety disorder, and 150 adults with no psychiatric disorder. To achieve this, we are recruiting 2530 individuals. Design: Subjects will be tested using fMRI paradigms designed to examine brain regions engaged when processing motivationally salient stimuli, as assessed during attention, memory, social interaction, reward, and fear-conditioning paradigms. After these initial fMRI tests, subjects with depression or an anxiety disorder receive treatment. Treatment will comprise open treatment with either fluoxetine or CBT, augmented with computer-based attention retraining, delivered in a randomized-controlled design, with random assignment to either active or placebo attentiontraining regimens. Adolescent subjects then will be re-tested after eight-weeks using only the attention, memory, and conditioning paradigms. Outcome Measures: Prior imaging studies note that tasks requiring attention modulation, emotional memory, social interchange, and fear conditioning engage brain regions previously implicated in adult mood and anxiety disorders. These regions include most consistently the amygdala and ventral prefrontal cortex. Moreover, imaging studies of reward function implicate the striatum and prefrontal cortex in adult mood disorders. As a result, we hypothesize that attention, memory, social interaction, reward, and conditioning paradigms will engage the amygdala, ventral prefrontal cortex and striatum in both psychiatrically healthy and impaired subjects. Moreover, we hypothesize that these healthy and psychiatrically impaired groups will differ in the degree of engagement. Juvenile subjects also will be treated for eight-weeks, and a subset will be re-tested with fMRI. We predict that pre-treatment abnormalities in neural circuitry will predict response to treatment, such that increased amygdala and prefrontal activation will occur in individuals who show the strongest response to treatment. Moreover, we hypothesize that effective treatment will normalize abnormalities in attention and emotional memory, as manifest in fMRI. \n",

      "Title = Identification and Treatment of Feeder Vessels in Macular Degeneration.\n",
      " This study will try to identify and treat feeder vessels in age-related macular degeneration. The macula is the part of the retina in the back of the eye that determines central or best vision. In macular degeneration, leaking blood vessels under the macula lead to loss of central vision. These vessels branch out tree-like from one or more feeder vessels. Instead of treating all the abnormal branching vessels, this study will try to find and close only the feeder vessels, thereby depriving the abnormal vessels of nutrition. The vessels will be closed with laser beam treatment. People 50 years of age and older with macular degeneration and visual acuity worse than 20/50 in the study eye and the same or better vision in the other eye may be eligible for this study. Candidates will undergo fluorescein angiography to try to locate feeder vessels. For this procedure, a yellow dye is injected into an arm vein. The dye travels to the blood vessels in the eyes, and pictures of the retina are taken using a camera that flashes a blue light into the eye. The pictures show if any dye has leaked from the vessels into the retina, indicating possible blood vessel abnormality. Before laser treatment, participants will have a complete eye examination, including measurement of visual acuity, evaluation of the front part of the eye with a slit lamp microscope, examination of the retina with an ophthalmoscope, and measurement of eye pressure using a tonometer. During the laser treatment phase of the study, participants will have indocyanine green angiography-a procedure similar to fluorescein angiography, but using a green dye-to photograph the retina and identify feeder vessels. If feeder vessels are located, laser beam treatment will begin. For this procedure, the eye is anesthetized with numbing drops. A special contact lens is then placed on the eye for the laser treatment. The number of treatments depends on how well the individual patient responds, but usually between two and eight treatments are required. The indocyanine green angiogram will be repeated after the laser beam treatment to determine if the feeder vessels have been successfully closed. If the vessels remain partially open, a repeat application will be done, followed by another indocyanine green angiogram to check the results. Patients will be checked in the clinic after 1 week to see if additional treatment is needed. If so, re-treatment will be done in a week. If no re-treatment is required, follow-up visits will be scheduled 2, 3, and 6 weeks after treatment, 3 and 6 months after treatment, and every 6 months after that for 2 years to evaluate treatment results. The evaluations will include fluorescein angiograms and other examinations that were done before starting treatment. If abnormal vessels are still present or growing, repeat treatments will be applied following the same procedure. \n",
      " Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) represents the most common cause of blindness in patients over the age of 60. Most vision loss in this disease results from sequelae of choroidal neovascular membrane (CNVM) formation. CNVM is usually composed of well-formed neovascularization and occult (less well-formed) neovascularization. While clinical trials have shown that some patients, mostly those with well-formed CNVM, may benefit from laser photocoagulation or photodynamic therapy, at present there is no treatment for patients who have combined CNVM lesions (both well-formed and occult) whose area of occult neovascularization is greater than 50% or who have other presentation of CNVM such as pigment-epithelial detachment or neovascular fibrosis. Retinal histopathology of patients with choroidal neovascularization has revealed that areas of CNVM are usually fed by a few smaller choroidal feeder vessels originating from the choroid or choriocapillaris. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that closure of these feeder vessels would infarct the large CNVM complex. Until recently, identification of these feeder vessels has been difficult but new high speed indocyanine imaging of the choroid (Phi-motion) indocyanine green angiography (ICG) has allowed for more precise detection of these vessels. We will test this hypothesis by utilizing Phi-motion ICG to identify choroidal feeder vessels in patients with CNVM not amenable to approved treatments. If feeder vessels are identified, then pulse-diode laser photocoagulation will be used to attempt closure of these vessels. The study is designed to provide information on the feasibility of standardizing this procedure and estimating its potential efficacy. The primary outcome will be a greater than 50% reduction in the area of leakage from the neovascular component as determined by fluorescein angiogram. Secondary outcomes will include a complete resolution of leakage measured by fluorescein angiography, the number of repetitive laser treatments undergone, the number of patients eligible by fluorescein angiogram but without identifiable feeder vessels, and the number of patients with vision loss, from baseline, of 15 letters or more, 30 letters or more, or are reduced to less than 5 letters read. All adverse events regardless of severity or relatedness to the therapy will be collected and summarized. Assessment of all outcomes will be made at 6 weeks, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months post laser treatment, and 24 months after enrollment. This study will give investigators some insight into this technology and the feasibility of this treatment in patients with various forms of neovascular AMD. In addition, the results of the study will provide the foundation for larger studies of this therapy. \n",

      " The primary objective of this multi-center sub-study of USPHS Study 23: \"Intensive Pharmacokinetic Study of Intermittent Rifabutin and Isoniazid with Daily Efavirenz in Combination with Two Nucleoside Analogs for Treatment of HIV and Tuberculosis Co-infections,\" is to compare the pharmacokinetics of rifabutin at 600 mg twice a week in combination with efavirenz 600 mg daily to the pharmacokinetics of rifabutin 300 mg twice a week without efavirenz. Secondary objectives are: (1) To describe pharmacokinetics of both rifabutin and efavirenz in combination regimen, (2) To evaluate the safety of concomitant efavirenz and rifabutin, (3) To assess the effect on absolute neutrophil count by changing rifabutin dose and adding efavirenz to the regimen, (4) To develop models of optimal sampling times for rifabutin dosed twice a week, (5) To describe the pharmacokinetics of isoniazid in combination with efavirenz daily with two NRTIs, (6) To compare the pharmacokinetics of isoniazid with and without efavirenz. \n",
      " BACKGROUND: There are two concerns regarding rifabutin and INH pharmacokinetics in this population: 1) Malabsorption of anti-TB medications is frequent in this population and 2) Many antiretrovirals and other drugs frequently used in the management of HIV-infected individuals are inhibitors of the cytochrome p450 3A4 isoform and result in increased levels of rifabutin. Correlation of the pharmacokinetic and clinical outcomes in the setting of these interactions is essential. METHODS: The study will be done on the General Clinical Research Center at Duke University Medical Center, on an inpatient basis (depending on where the patient lives). No one who is suspected of being infectious or is infectious from TB will be enrolled on the GCRC. After informed consent is obtained, each subject will be admitted to the GCRC twice; the first admission will occur after at least four twice weekly doses of intermittent rifabutin and prior to beginning antiretroviral therapy and the second admission will occur two to six weeks following the institution of an antiretroviral regimen including efavirenz. During Admission #1, blood will be drawn at 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 21 hours post dosing with INH and rifabutin. During Admission #2, blood will be drawn at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hours. Efavirenz will be given at time points 0 and 24 hours post sampling. TB drugs will be given at 3 hours (so that sampling times subsequent to INH/rifabutin dosing will correspond to those of Admission #1). Patients will be interviewed regarding concomitant medications, gastrointestinal symptoms and meals relative to study drug dosing. Sixty days following the last dose of PK study medicines, a follow-up visit or phone call (including review of medical record) will identify any adverse events. DATA ANALYSIS: Frequency distributions will include plots of the data, distribution curves to test for normality, parametric and non-parametric measures of central tendency and dispersion, as well as the Shapiro-Wilk W test for normality. Means will be reported + the standard deviation (SD). The percent coefficient of variation (CV) will be calculated as (SD/mean) multiplied by 100%. Correlation analysis (JMP) will be performed across the subject and outcome variables using non-parametric techniques (Spearman Rho, continuous data only). The dependence of outcome variables (the pharmacokinetic parameters) upon subject characteristics (demographic data such as age, weight, CD4 count, etc.) will be determined by using Y by X analyses, one parameter at a time (continuous or nominal data). Subsequently, models with multiple X variables will be constructed using forward addition and backward deletion. Correlations between parameters and covariates will be considered statistically significant at p 3/4 0.05. \n",

      "Title = The Genetics of Environmental Asthma.\n",
      " In this project, we hypothesize that polymorphisms of genes expressed by the airway epithelia in asthmatics following specific airway challenges predispose individuals to the development of asthma. To test this hypothesis, we identify the genes that are differentially expressed by airway epithelial cells following challenge with stimuli that induce acquired (house dust mite) or innate (LPS) immune responses, and then determine whether polymorphisms in these genes are associated with the development of asthma in a separate, well characterized, familial cohort of asthmatics. This is a powerful approach that is designed to identify novel genes that are associated with both asthma pathogenesis (differentially expressed in the exposure-response study) and asthma susceptibility (genetically associated with asthma in a linkage/association study). \n",
      " The overall goal of this project is to identify genes that are involved in the development of airflow obstruction and airway inflammation in asthmatics, and to determine whether polymorphisms in these differentially expressed genes predispose individuals to develop asthma. Asthma is a complex genetic disorder that is caused by a number of unique gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. The search for asthma susceptibility genes has been complicated by the broad clinical phenotype of asthma, the polygenic inheritance pattern of this disease, and the substantial role of environmental exposures in the development and progression of asthma. Inhaled environmental agents induce several biologic responses in asthmatics; including the induction of acquired and innate immunity that leads to acute and chronic forms of airway inflammation and airway remodeling. Acquired immune responses to protein antigens, such as house dust mite allergen, often induce type 2 T lymphocyte-driven responses (Th2) which appear to be important in atopic asthma. Recent studies by our group and others demonstrate that innate immunity, initiated by inhalation of bacterial and viral pathogens, organic dusts, endotoxin or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), air pollution particulate matter, and ozone, can also cause acute and chronic forms of airflow obstruction, airway inflammation, and even airway remodeling. Emerging evidence indicates that both acquired and innate immune responses in the lung may be influenced by polymorphic genes. For instance, functional polymorphisms in the IL-4 receptor gene are thought to preferentially stimulate acquired Th2 immune responses to inhaled allergens, and we have recently shown that common co-segregating mutations in TLR4 (a transmembrane receptor for LPS) are associated with diminished airway responsiveness to inhaled LPS. These observations suggest that environmental challenges can be used to narrow the phenotype of asthma and investigate genetic susceptibility in biologically specific forms of asthma. \n",

To evaluate the therapeutic effect of glutamine and creatine monohydrate on muscle strength in children with DMD. To validate the use of QMT (quantitative muscle strength testing) and gait analysis in children with DMD as reliable tools to quantify muscle strength, monitor disease progression and assess therapeutic response. \n",
      " Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common lethal inherited disorder worldwide. Despite the exponential increase in our understanding of the disorder since the discovery and characterization of the causative gene and its product dystrophin in 1987, current therapeutic management remains largely supportive. Awaiting a final genetic cure to be available in the future, further investments in developing better drug therapies for DMD remain important. Not only because the uniform use of prednisone (the only drug proven to be beneficial) is hampered by potential adverse effects, but also because it may very well be the case that ultimately a combination of both gene and drug therapy will be needed to cure Duchenne children. Here, we test two compounds that have shown promise in a 45-drug screen in the mdx mouse model of Duchenne dystrophy. The effect of glutamine (0.6/kg/day) and creatine monohydrate (5g/day) on muscle strength will be evaluated in a multi-center randomized double-blind placebo-controlled 3-arm study. Ambulant children aged 5-10 years with an established DMD diagnosis will be studied. Patients will undergo 2 screening evaluations within 2 weeks. Patients will be randomized into treatment groups on the second screening visits, followed by a 6-month treatment period. During the treatment period, patients will be evaluated at monthly intervals. The primary endpoints are percentage change in average muscle strength score and QMT performance for specific muscle groups. Secondary endpoints include timed function tests, functional grades for arms and legs, and pulmonary function tests. \n",

      " This grant is to study patients that have received a kidney transplant AND an Islet Cell transplant and to discover how the transplant is functioning. We will seek to have several patients who have had a kidney transplant but do NOT have either type of diabetes. These patients will serve as the \"control group\" since they will also be on immunosuppressive medications but are not affected by abnormal blood sugars. This will allow investigators to develop an understanding of how these immunosuppressive medications affect glucose metabolism (blood sugar levels) and insulin utilization (how the body uses insulin). \n",
      " If Islet Cell transplants are to become a reasonable treatment alternative for patients with type 1 diabetes, there must be knowledge about how the islet cells function after transplant {islet cells are responsible for making the insulin the body needs in order to control blood sugar). This knowledge would allow for improvements in the islet cell transplant procedure itself, as well as possible alterations of the immunosuppressive medications (drugs that prevent rejection) that are prescribed. There are two basic kinds of diabetes, type 1 (formally known as Insulin Dependent or Juvenile diabetes) and type 2 (formally known as Adult-Onset or Non-insulin dependent) diabetes. The patients in this study will be affected by type 1 diabetes. After the transplant, it is hoped they will no longer need insulin injections. It is possible patients may need to take pioglitazone and/or metformin, however, this will be prescribed in Project 1, if needed. The medications used for this study include: C-peptide. This is a synthetic product (not from human or animal sources) that is man-made and identical to the C-peptide made by the body. C-peptide is made at the same time as insulin, one molecule of insulin equals one molecule C-peptide. By giving C-peptide that is synthetic, researchers can measure how the C-peptide breaks down in the body, which could then be related to how insulin breaks down in the body. Somatostatin will also be used during the same test as the C-peptide. While receiving Somatostatin, the production of insulin by the patient will be stopped. This medication will only be given for 4 hours and the blood sugar will be monitored during the entire procedure. Insulin & Glucose will also be given by IV during certain tests to regulate the blood sugar. Blood sugars will be maintained within a certain level and this will be achieved through the administration of insulin and/or glucose. The patient's blood sugar will be monitored at frequent intervals throughout the various procedures. \n",

This chronic elevation in iPTH can have adverse consequences, thus a variety of phosphate binders are given in an attempt to decrease the absorption of phosphorus present in the normal diet. Some preliminary studies have indicated that the iPTH level may change based on the amount of phosphorus present in a meal prior to any significant absorption of phosphorus. If this is true in hemodialysis patients, then the timing of the administration of phosphate binders in relation to the ingestion of meals needs to be considered \n",

Calcium acetate, aluminum hydroxide, and sevelamer (Renagel) will be given on separate occasions in conjunction with a high phosphorus meal. They will be given in standard doses used in the treatment of high phosphorus levels in hemodialysis patients. The population targeted will included hemodialysis patients with elevated iPTH and phosphorus levels. The patients will receive up to five separate meals. Four of these will be high phosphorus content meals and one will be a low phosphorus content meal. On up to three occasions with the high phosphorus content meals the patients will ingest one of the three phosphate binders. The meals will be ingested after a twelve-hour overnight fast. Labs will be drawn prior to meal ingestion and then at 15, 30, 60, 120 and 240-minute intervals. The labs will consist of iPTH, phosphorus, calcium, and glucose. A serum albumin level will be obtained with the initial specimen only. The patients will have an iPTH level of at least 200pg/ml and a serum phosphorus level of at least 4.0 mg/dl.

      " Previous studies have found that nicotine/mecamylamine treatment more than doubles the long-term abstinence rates relative to nicotine replacement alone. Recent evidence supports the hypothesis that nicotine/mecamylamine treatment prior to smoking cessation partially blocks the rewarding effects of cigarette smoking and hence promotes extinction of the smoking habit, facilitating subsequent abstinence. The behavioral approach employed is also an extinction strategy and involves having smokers switch to de-nicotinized tobacco cigarettes for two weeks prior to quitting smoking. It is hypothesized that the use of de-nicotinized cigarettes might provide more complete extinction than provided by the partial pharmacologic blockade using nicotine/mecamylamine alone. The pharmacologic treatment was expected to increase compliance with the de-nicotinized cigarette smoking regimen, because subjects' usual brands of cigarettes will be less appealing than in the absence of nicotine/mecamylamine treatment. Together the brand-switching and nicotine/mecamylamine therapies were expected to reduce cravings and other withdrawal symptoms as well as increase long-term abstinence from smoking. \n",

      " This project is a treatment-matching study to test whether adding antidepressant pharmacotherapy to behavioral cessation treatment improves the depression-prone smoker's ability to quit, while not undermining cessation goals for the smoker who lacks a history of depression. The study target is to randomize 120 smokers with a prior history of depression and 120 smokers who lack such a history to a double-blind treatment with either 60 mg fluoxetine or placebo, while they undergo cognitive behavioral treatment to quit smoking. \n",
      " The aim of this research is to examine whether adding antidepressant pharmacotherapy to behavioral cessation treatment improves the depression-prone smoker's ability to quit, while not undermining cessation for the smoker who lacks a history of depression, by randomizing smokers both with and without such a history to double-blind treatment with either 60 mg fluoxetine or placebo. The primary Depressive Episode Hypothesis states that the stress of quitting smoking and the biological challenge of nicotine withdrawal trigger a depressive episode in vulnerable individuals. To the extent that episode onset can be prevented by prophylactic administration of antidepressant pharmacotherapy, smokers with a history of depression will show significantly higher abstinence rates when treated with fluoxetine than placebo, whereas no drug effect will be evident for history negative smokers who lack the depressive diathesis. An alternative generalized withdrawal hypothesis construes post-cessation dysphoria as one general manifestation of a nicotine withdrawal syndrome that occurs independently of depressive vulnerability, and predicts that fluoxetine, as compared to placebo, will uniformly improve cessation outcomes, regardless of whether smokers possess the diathesis for depression. Over period of four years, the study hopes to randomize 120 smokers with a history of depression and 120 smokers who lack such a history to double-blind treatment with either 60 mg fluoxetine or placebo, while they undergo group cognitive behavioral treatment to quit smoking. To allow plasma drug levels to stabilize before quitting smoking, drug or placebo treatment begins 3 weeks before quitting smoking and continues for an additional 8 weeks following the quit date. Participants will be followed up monthly for 4 months after the end of treatment in order to assess the main study outcome; abstinence from smoking 6 months after the quit date. \n",

      " Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the leading cause of death in the elderly. Silent myocardial ischemia (SI) is a manifestation of CAD in which there is a transient alteration in myocardial perfusion, function, and/or electrical activity not accompanied by chest pain. Mental and emotional stress, in particular hostility and anger are potent inducers of SI, Individuals with SI are at a 3-5 fold higher risk for the development of angina, myocardial infarction and death than subjects without SI. \n",
      " The hypothesis of this study is that older individuals with occult cad, mental stress/ emotional arousal (anger) increases sympathetic nervous system activity resulting in vasoconstriction thereby eliciting transient episodes of SI. Therefore an aerobic exercise intervention that reduces the response to anger/hostility and improves vascular compliance will decrease the ischemic burden in SI patients. The specific objectives are: To determine if non-smoking older individuals with exercise-induced SI have increased vasoreactivity (blood pressure, heart rate) responses to the laboratory presentation of mental stressors, decreased vascular compliance and brachial artery endothelial reactivity compared to matched non-ischemic controls; 2) To perform a randomized clinical trial that will examine the effects of 9 months of aerobic exercise training versus usual care on vasoreactivity, vascular compliance and ischemic burden on Holter monitor. Older individuals without a history of overt CAD will be recruited and evaluated for the presence of exercise-induced SI. Baseline cross-sectional comparisons of vasoreactivity and cardiovascular function will be performed between those with SI and non-ischemic controls. The individuals with SI will be enrolled in a randomized clinical trial of exercise vs usual care. Exercise treadmill testing with measurement of maximal aerobic capacity will be used to determine fitness. Vasoactivity will be quantified during a mental stress test with real time 2d echo imaging.

      " Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, the fourth leading cause of death, and has enormous economic and emotional costs for caregivers of patients. Most of the patients with AD develop disruptive, agitated behaviors at some point during the ailment that are a common catalyst for placement in long-term care settings where they represent more than half of all the residents. Disruptive behaviors create stress for both staff and patients in long-term care settings, reduce patient quality of life because of excess use of physical restraints, and drain the financial resources of the facilities. This study proposes to design specific interventions designed to decrease disruptive, agitated behavior in patients with AD residing in long-term care facilities. This 12-week study will assess the efficacy of two pharmacological agents, an atypical neuroleptic (risperidone) and an anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer (gabapentin) while identifying moderators of differential treatment response to the two drugs. Specifically, this study aims to randomize 130 patients with AD who are manifesting agitated disruptive behavior, into two groups of 65 patients each, with one group receiving risperidone and the other gabapentin. There are two main hypotheses: 1) Patients in both of the treatment groups will manifest different overall group decreases in ratings of disruptive, agitated behavior; and 2) Measurable, clinical characteristics will identify subgroups of subjects with differential treatment response to the two medications. The two variables to be considered as moderators are as follows: a) Patients with higher psychosis ratings will manifest greater responsivity to risperidone compared to gabapentin, and b) Patients with high levels of affective lability will manifest greater responsivity to gabapentin compared to risperidone. \n",

The hypothesis is that adherence to a LPD will result in a reduction in skeletal muscle mass and reduced strength and functional capacity while those patients who adhere to the LPD and exercise will demonstrate a similar preservation of renal function but will have greater fat free mass, muscle mass and strength. The intervention trial will last 18 months in which patients with moderate renal failure will be randomly assigned to one of 4 interventions: standard care, standard care + exercise, LPD, and LPD with exercise. In this way the independent and combined effects of diet and exercise on the progression of renal disease and body composition will be monitored. This study will have important implications for the treatment of patients with chronic renal failure. New strategies of combining exercise with recommendations of a low protein diet may slow the progression of renal disease and improve strength and functional capacity in these at-risk patients. \n",
      " Management of dietary protein intake of the CRF patient represents a critical balance between providing adequate protein to meet nutritional requirements, and limiting protein intake in the hope of slowing or abating the progression of CRF. A number of studies have demonstrated that reduced dietary protein intake can slow the progression of chronic renal failure. Finding effective ways to increase nitrogen retention and decrease urinary nitrogen excretion may help CRF patients maintain a more positive nitrogen balance and lessen the nitrogen load on the kidneys for a given dietary protein intake. Our laboratory has demonstrated that in older men and women, the consequence of adherence to a low protein diet is an accommodation that results in decreased muscle mass, strength,and compromised immune function. We have also demonstrated that when healthy, free living older men and women consume a weight maintenance diet providing the RDA for protein of 0.8 g/kg-1/day-1 for 15 weeks they lose skeletal muscle mass. These data clearly indicate that elderly people have an increased need for dietary protein (compared to young people). Data has also demonstrated that progressive resistance exercise improves nitrogen balance in older healthy individuals as well as in patients with mild to moderate chronic renal failure. \n",

      " The purpose of this study is to determine whether genetic factors contribute to an individuals risk of developing obstructive lung disease from smoking cigarettes. \n",
      " Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is among the most important chronic diseases of adults. It is the fourth leading cause of death in the U.S. and affects more than 10% of the U.S. population over age 55. COPD accounts for more than 25,000 discharges annually from VA medical centers. Cigarette smoking is the most important known modifiable cause of COPD, yet only 15-20% of cigarette smokers develop clinically significant COPD. We therefore hypothesize that genetic mechanisms determine susceptibility to the development of COPD. The only genetic abnormality known to cause COPD is deficiency of the serine protease inhibitor 1-protease inhibitor, which causes premature development of emphysema, although it is implicated in fewer than 2% of COPD cases. Several other genetic variants have been proposed as candidate causes of COPD; however, these have been identified on the basis of association studies in unrelated subjects, which have considerable risk of ascertainment bias. In the present study, a sub-pair linkage approach will be utilized in COPD patients and their smoking siblings to identify genes which determine the risk of developing COPD. The following are the short-term objectives of this study: 1. Recruit a cohort of 400 probands with smoking-related COPD and their smoking siblings, whether or not affected by COPD. Affected subjects will be extensively characterized as to specific COPD phenotype, using spirometry, computed tomography, and questionnaire data. 2. Test the association of known genetic variants in candidate genes to the presence of COPD. 3. For proposed candidate genes without known candidate polymorphisms, use sib-pair linkage analysis to test polymorphic marker loci in close proximity to the candidate gene for evidence of linkage to COPD. 4. Test for heterogeneity of linkage among different COPD phenotypes: predominant emphysema versus predominant airway disease. The long-term objective of this research is the identification of specific genetic variants which confer risk for the development of COPD in smokers. This will be achieved by means of fine mapping of the loci identified in objectives 3-4 above, or in a subsequent genome scan involving the 400 sibling pairs; identification of novel genetic variants at these loci; and assessment of the functional significance of these variants and their relation to COPD in an independent sample of subjects. Recruitment of subjects for this project began in April, 1999. At this time, a total of 22 subjects (11 COPD patients and 11 first-degree relatives) have been recruited and tested. No adverse events have occurred. A computerized methodology for quantitation of emphysema from CT scans has been developed and has demonstrated adequate DNA extraction from our blood samples. Genotyping has been deferred pending the recruitment of 50 subjects. \n",

      " Current projects study veteran patients with chronic ulcers and MRSA colonization and infection, patients with imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa colonization and infection, the relationships between staffing pattern, severity of illness and nosocomial infections in intensive care units and infection control practices for veteran patients with suspected tuberculosis. \n",
      " Nosocomial infections are often caused by antimicrobial-resistant pathogens such as vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) and are a major cause increased morbidity, mortality and cost in hospitalized patients. Nosocomial bloodstream infections (BSI) add 7 to 21 days to the length of stay and cost institutions $3,061 to $40,000. The average cost of treating patients with VRE BSI has been estimated as 30% more than vancomycin sensitive enterococcal BSI. In addition, the attributable mortality of VRE BSI has been estimated as 37%. Preventing VRE infection and VRE transmission is clearly important and understanding the risk factors for each is a necessary first step. The goal of this three year study is to identify potentially effective interventions for the prevention of VRE infection and colonization Before testing interventions, we need to identify risk factors for VRE infection which will allow us to (1) identify potentially effective interventions and (2) focus on patients at highest risk for VRE infection. We will study the effect of antibiotic use, particularly vancomycin, and impaired host defenses on VRE infection in a large cohort study of VRE colonized patients. The goal is to develop a statistical model, which will allow us to identify alterable risk factors, which could reduce the risk of VRE infection. Many case-control studies have been performed to study VRE colonization and infection; however, most of these studies were small with insufficient sample sizes for multivariate modeling. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) can be transmitted from patient to patient. We propose to model the ecological relationship between the rate of VRE transmission and the pre-existing prevalence of VRE in an ICU to determine whether the relationship is linear or exponential. The objective is to determine at what point the rate of transmission increases significantly that specific interventions should occur (e.g. reverse isolation of all patients, close unit to new admissions). Controlling health care costs is an important part of health care today and is particularly important in the capitated reimbursement system that VHA is adopting. Potential interventions to prevent VRE infections and VRE transmission must be cost-effective to the healthcare system to justify their adoption. The current study will quantify the operational costs associated with VRE colonization and infection in hospitalized patients compared to their non-colonized counterparts. Patients from the intensive care units with and without VRE colonization will be covaried for severity of illness and stratified by Major Diagnostic Category (by primary ICD-9 code) and marginal health care costs compared. This estimate can then be used to examine the potential cost-effectiveness of identified interventions, and to justify the system-wide costs of implementing these interventions. \n",

Another goal of this study is to better identify the patients most likely to benefit from this surgical treatment. The information obtained in this study is important because lung reduction surgery is being done in several centers around the country but its long term benefits, if any, over standard medical treatment, are not known. \n",
      " Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in the US. Although medical therapy may delay disability and death, there has been no definitive therapy to improve pulmonary function in these patients. The resection of emphysematous lung parenchyma, lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS), has been reported in uncontrolled studies in highly selected emphysema patients to substantially improve parameters of pulmonary function, dyspnea, and quality of life. Numerous case series have reported significant short-term benefits. Current LVRS data regarding outcomes is limited by study design lacking parallel control groups and lack of long term data. The main objectives of this proposal are: 1) To study the effects of LVRS in addition to maximal medical therapy when compared to maximal medical therapy alone in terms of improvement of physiology and quality of life. 2) To better define preoperative selection criteria to determine which patients would benefit from this surgical intervention. To accomplish these objectives, patients who meet clinical criteria and complete a pulmonary rehabilitation-program will be randomized into 2 groups: 1) Continuing optimal medical care or 2) bilateral LVRS via median sternotomy in addition to medical therapy. The Houston Veterans Affairs Medical Center is currently performing LVRS under a protocol supported by Merit Review funding (1996-200O, Effects of lung volume reduction surgery in the treatment of severe emphysema) in selected patients with severe emphysema. This controlled study is designed to determine patient selection criteria, as well as, both the short and long term benefits of operated and non-operated patients with severe emphysema receiving maximal medical therapy. Given the strict selection criteria and unexpectedly high survival in both treatment groups to date, it is unlikely in a study of this size that survival differences will be detected. In 1997 the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and Health Care Financing Administration organized a national registry and a controlled, multicenter clinical trial to compare bilateral LVRS to maximal medical treatment (NETT, National Emphysema Treatment Trial). Both our on-going LVRS study and the NETT have been hindered by an underestimation of the difficulty in recruiting patients who qualify for this invasive study. Both studies have evaluated/recruited to date approximately 50% of the projected number of subjects required to achieve statistical power to draw significant clinical conclusions. In fact, the NIH is investing additional funds in the national \"marketing\" of the NETT and LVRS. We believe that this national marketing effort, as well as changes and enhancement of local recruiting strategies will allow us to enroll adequate patients for study completion. This controlled clinical trial will provide data to address crucial clinical and potential economic implications of this surgical intervention in patients with severe emphysema. \n",

Slowness can be related to a specific disease process, as in negative schizophrenia or depression or it can be the result of medications used to treat forms of mental illness. Prior research has lead to a novel instrumental approach for distinguishing subtypes of motor slowing - one type related to cognitive processes and another related to parkinsonism. The purpose of this study is to test whether new medications used to treat schizophrenia improve the cognitive or parkinsonian components of motor slowing. Patients will be studied in the laboratory before and 8-weeks after starting a new antipsychotic. The n of this study = 60 patients. The results of this study will improve our understanding of the complex interactions between cognitive processing and motor behavior in patients with psychotic illnesses and how drugs work to treat these problems. \n",

      " The primary goals for this investigation are to quantify: (1) fluctuations in PTSD symptom reports when assessed at bi-weekly intervals; (2) change in PTSD symptoms associated with stressful life events; and (3) change in PTSD symptoms associated with perceived social support. Despite increased sophistication in measurement of PTSD, little is known about the long-term longitudinal course of this disorder or the fluctuation of symptoms over time. Because previous studies have focused on the development and persistence of symptoms immediately following a stressor, the course of the chronic disorder has been largely unexplored. Although there is evidence of both persistence and fluctuation of PTSD symptom presentation in Vietnam veterans, little is known about how much and in what ways symptoms change over time. This investigation will increase understanding of the nature and extent of symptom fluctuation as well as the longitudinal course of PTSD as first steps in determining which variables affect that course and how clinicians might intervene to alter it. Aversive life events may constitute one factor that influences the course of chronic PTSD. Researchers and clinicians have frequently hypothesized that stressful life events account for much of the variability in course of chronic PTSD; individuals with PTSD may have a compromised ability to cope with stressors, and such events may worsen existing symptoms. Social support is another variable thought to affect the course of post-trauma symptomatology. Support from other persons has been shown to both promote psychological health in general and to protect against psychological deterioration in times of stress. This investigation will examine aversive life events and perceived social support to determine their relationships over time to symptoms of PTSD. \n",

      " More than 10,000 people each year in the United States have \"failed back surgery syndrome\" caused by scars that form around the outer surface of the spinal cord. Such scarring, known as peridural fibrosis, is common after back surgery known as either lumbar discectomy or laminectomy. Peridural fibrosis may cause recurring low back pain or leg pain after surgery. Operating again to remove the scar tissue often leads to more scarring. Researchers have not previously studied radiation as a way to prevent peridural fibrosis. We will test whether low-dose radiation given 24 hours before surgery will decrease the amount of peridural fibrosis and if this reduction will lead to improved results of surgery. Half of the participants will receive radiation before surgery and the other half will not. We will evaluate patients at followup visits 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery with a physical exam and questionnaire. At 12 months, we will obtain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lower spine. \n",
      " Researchers have long known that low-dose radiation inhibits fibroblast and osteoblast activity. Studies in humans have shown that perioperative radiation therapy is a useful way to prevent both keloid and heterotopic bone formation. However, researchers have not previously studied radiation as a means to inhibit peridural fibrosis. Our previous studies of both rat and dog models showed a significant reduction in peridural fibrosis after laminectomy using low-dose external beam radiation (700 cGy) given 24 hours prior to surgery. Based on our results from these animal studies, we will test whether (1) low-dose radiation given 24 hours before surgery will decrease the amount of peridural fibrosis in people and (2) this reduction in peridural fibrosis will lead to improved results of surgery. For this study, we will enroll 46 patients with failed back surgery syndrome believed to be secondary to perineural fibrosis in a randomized, double-blinded, controlled clinical trial. We will assign patients to one of two groups before surgery: preoperative radiation (treatment group) or no preoperative radiation (control group). We will treat half of the patients with external beam radiation before re-exploration and decompression of their peridural fibrosis (treatment group) and perform re-exploration and decompression in the other half without preoperative radiation (control group). All patients will undergo simulation radiation treatment planning and will not know if they received radiation or not. For patients randomized to receive preoperative radiation, we will administer a single dose of 700 cGy to a 6.0-cm-wide field centered on the spinal cord at the affected level, using a 6 MV Varian 600C linear accelerator. We will administer treatment with two fields angled 45 degrees from the vertical plane so that the skin surface for the proposed incision will not be irritated. This should prevent any wound healing problems. Only the radiation oncologist and research assistant will know whether radiation was administered. The patient and the surgeon will be masked as to the treatment. The neurosurgeon co-investigators will perform the same surgical procedure on all patients 24 hours after their radiation (or sham) treatment. We will give all patients preoperative antibiotics. The surgeon will reopen the previous midline posterior lumbar skin incision and dissect the subcutaneous tissue away from the spinous process and laminae. Once the surgeon has adequately exposed the previous surgical site, he or she will place a self-retaining retractor. The surgeon will decompress the nerve by removing the scar tissue from around the nerve root and thecal sac. The surgeon will also remove any intravertebral disc material thought to be causing nerve root compression. On completion of the operation, the surgeon will stop bleeding with electrocautery, irrigate the wound with antibiotic, and close the wound in layers. In general, the hospital stay after surgery is one night. The patient begins gradual ambulation on the evening of surgery. We will administer the North American Spine Society (NASS) Lumbar Spine Outcome Assessment to patients before treatment and at followup visits to assess their physical functioning. We will also use the NASS questionnaire to collect demographic and lifestyle information at baseline and to assess patient expectations regarding treatment and level of satisfaction with the treatment during the followup period. We will do a physical examination and administer the patient-reported questionnaire prior to surgery and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. We will obtain magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the lumbar spine 12 months after treatment. \n",

All other patients, including those with lymphoblastic lymphoma without bone marrow involvement, are considered high risk and they are assigned to treatment group 1. - Group 1 (high risk): Patients receive one course of regimen A comprising CTX IV over 15 minutes on days 1-4; VCR IV on days 1, 8, and 15; doxorubicin (DOX) IV on days 1 and 2; ARA-C IV over 3 hours every 12 hours on day 1; ARA-C IT on day 4; and MTX IT on days 8 and 12. Patients then receive one course of regimen B comprising ifosfamide IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5, etoposide IV over 1 hour and MTX IV on days 1-3, VCR IV on day 8, ARA-C IT on days 1 and 4, and MTX IT as in regimen A. Patients then receive a second course of regimen A, followed by a second course of regimen B. - Group 2 (low risk): Patients receive one course of regimen A, followed by one course of regimen B, and then a second course of regimen A. DOX is withheld during both courses of regimen A. IT therapy is withheld during the second course of regimen A. Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year (Protocol MCP-841) or at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 months (Protocol MCP-842), every 6 months for 5 years, and then annually thereafter.

      " RATIONALE: Radiofrequency interstitial tissue ablation may kill tumor cells by heating tumors to several degrees above body temperature. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying radiofrequency interstitial tissue ablation to see how well it works in treating patients with localized renal cell carcinoma (kidney cancer). \n",
      " OBJECTIVES: Primary - Evaluate the efficacy of radiofrequency interstitial tissue ablation in terms of tumor destruction or slowed tumor growth rate in patients with localized renal cell carcinoma. Secondary - Assess the toxicity of this treatment regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients undergo percutaneous radiofrequency interstitial tumor ablation (RFA). Patients are offered laparoscopy-assisted percutaneous RFA in the operating room if their tumors are not safely accessible. Intra-operative ultrasound is used to confirm probe placement and to monitor treatment delivery. If the target temperature or impedance are not reached, treatment is repeated no more than twice. No more than 5 tumors are treated per kidney. All patients are followed at 2 to 3 months, 6 months, and then at 1 year. Patients with tumors greater than 2 cm in diameter are followed every 6 months for up to 5 years. Patients whose tumors become greater than 3 cm are recommended for surgery and removed from study if surgery is performed. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 63 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year. \n",

      "Title = Isolated Limb Perfusion of Melphalan With or Without Tumor Necrosis Factor in Treating Patients With Soft Tissue Sarcoma of the Arm or Leg.\n",
      " RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Infusing melphalan directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to healthy tissues. It is not yet known whether melphalan plus tumor necrosis factor is more effective than melphalan alone for soft tissue sarcoma. PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of isolated limb perfusion of melphalan with or without tumor necrosis factor in treating patients who have soft tissue sarcoma of the arm or leg. \n",
      " OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rates, duration of response, patterns of recurrence and overall survival in patients with unresectable high grade soft tissue sarcomas of the extremity following isolated limb perfusion (ILP) using melphalan with or without tumor necrosis factor (TNF). II. Determine the application of these regimens as neoadjuvant therapy to render an unresectable sarcoma resectable. III. Determine whether either regimen results in durable disease control and limb salvage for patients with multifocal unresectable high grade soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity or patients with stage IV soft tissue sarcoma with symptomatic primary extremity tumor. PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms: Arm I: Patients receive isolated limb perfusion (ILP) with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and melphalan. After the limb is warmed, TNF is injected into the arterial line of the extracorporeal ILP circuit over 2-3 minutes beginning at time 0, and perfusion proceeds for another 25 minutes. Melphalan is injected into the same line over 3-5 minutes and perfusion with both drugs continues for another 60 minutes. Arm II: Patients receive ILP with melphalan alone. Melphalan is injected into the arterial line of the extracorporeal ILP circuit over 3-5 minutes beginning approximately 30 minutes after initiation of perfusion as in arm I, and perfusion proceeds for 60 minutes. Patients with potentially curable localized disease undergo a definitive local resection 4-12 weeks following ILP at the time of maximum tumor response as determined by physical exam and CT or MRI. Patients with microscopically positive viable tumor margins following resection receive adjuvant external beam radiotherapy as clinically indicated. If definitive local control cannot be confirmed with either local excision or biopsies, then amputation is recommended in the absence of unresectable metastatic disease. Local resection may also be performed on patients who achieve partial response. Patients with unresectable metastatic pulmonary disease who are undergoing ILP for palliative purposes do not undergo definitive resection. Patients are followed at 4-6 weeks, every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 4 months thereafter in the absence of disease progression. Patients expected to undergo interval resection are followed every 4 weeks until the procedure is scheduled. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-40 patients (6-20 per arm) will be accrued for this study. \n",

      " OBJECTIVES: - Determine the clinical response to immunization using gp100:44-59 antigen peptide plus gp100:209-217 (210M) and MART-1:26-35 (27L) antigen peptides in patients with metastatic melanoma who are HLA-DRB1*0401 and HLA-A0201 positive. - Determine the clinical response to immunization using gp100:44-59 antigen peptide alone in patients with metastatic melanoma who are HLA-DRB1*0401 positive but HLA-A0201 negative. - Determine the immunologic response in patients treated with these regimens as measured by changes in T-cell precursors from before to after treatment. - Evaluate the toxicity profiles of these regimens in these patients. OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to one of three immunization groups based on HLA-A0201 status and prior gp100:209-217 (210M) antigen peptide immunization: - Group 1 (HLA-A0201 positive and no prior gp100:209-217 [210M] antigen peptide): Patients receive gp100:44-59 and gp100:209-217 (210M) antigen peptides emulsified together in Montanide ISA-51 (ISA-51) subcutaneously (SC) and gp100:44-59 and MART-1:26-35 (27L) antigen peptides emulsified together in ISA-51 SC. - Group 2 (HLA-A0201 positive and prior gp100:209-217 [210M] antigen peptide): Patients receive treatment as in group 1. - Group 3 (HLA-A0201 negative and no prior gp100:209-217 [210M] antigen peptide): Patients receive gp100:44-59 antigen peptide emulsified in ISA-51 SC alone. - All groups: Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 4 doses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with complete response after 4 doses receive a maximum of 2 additional doses. Patients with stable disease or minor, mixed, or partial response after 4 doses receive a maximum of 12 additional doses. Patients with no response after 4 doses receive immunization with the same peptides and interleukin-2 IV over 15 minutes every 8 hours for a maximum of 12 doses beginning 1 day after each immunization. Patients are followed at 3-4 weeks. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45-75 patients (15-25 per immunization group) will be accrued for this study within 2 years. \n",
